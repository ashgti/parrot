=head1 TITLE

internals - Design and Implementation of Pipp

=head1 Source code

See L<pipp.pod>.

=head1 Issue tracking

See F<../ROADMAP> and L<pipp.pod>.

=head1 Testing

See L<testing.pod>.

=head1 Parsing

Parsing is done with Parrot Compiler Toolkit, PCT.

=head1 Bytecode generation

The parse tree is transformed to a Parrot Abstrace Syntax Tree, from which PIR und then Bytecode is generated.

=head1 Variables

=over 4

=item globals in top file

=item globals in included files

=item class scope

=item function and method scope

=item constants

=back

=head1 Functions and closures

=head2 Builtin functions

=head2 Closures

=head2 Internal functions

=head1 Object orientation

=head1 Namespaces

A namespace is introduced with the keyword B<namespace>. 
The namespaced code can be enclosed in brackets.
The namespace declaration needs to be the first statement in the file.
With brackets, there can be multiple namespaces per file. Nesting is not possible.
Namespaces don't carry over to included files.
B<define()> doesn't define in the current namespace.
The backslash character serves as the namespace separator.
Short names can be defined with B<use>.
Only classes, functions and constants are namespaced.
The current namespace can be queried with B<__NAMESPACE__>.
Namespaces are case insensitive.
No global code can precede the first B<namespace> directive.
Free code is disallowed within namespaces.

=head2 Implementation in Pipp

In order to ease implementation and testing, there will be
some divergences in Pipp. 
Only the bracketed syntax is supported.
Code outside the scope of namespaces directives is allowed.

=head1 Including and requiring

C<require_once()> is supported, but might have issues with variables. 

=head1 Extensions

=head2 Implementation in Pipp

Currently, Pipp has no support at all for extensions.
