Pipp doesn't have a detailed roadmap ar release planning.
But occasionally there are some TODOs that are planned:

i. Remove the variants after Parrot's december 2008 release.
ii. Host the code at github.com after Parrot's january 2009 release

Before moving to github I want to fix variable scope and support closures.
After that I will work on supporting the PHP extension system.
