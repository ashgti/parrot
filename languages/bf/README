DESCRIPTION

This is a Brainfuck interpreter for Parrot. Brainfuck is a full
computer programming language with only eight commands. For more
information, see http://www.catseye.mb.ca/esoteric/bf/ or 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck.

To compile the files:

  $ make

To check that the compiler is working:

  $ make test

To run an example Brainfuck program:

  $ ../../parrot bf.pasm helloworld.bf

There is also a compiler:

  $ ../../parrot bfc.imc helloworld.bf

Clifford Wolf <clifford (at) clifford.at> contributed a nice bf
program:

  $ cat cw.txt
  $ ../../parrot bf.pasm cw.bf < cw.txt > cw.c
  $ cc -o cw cw.c
  $ ./cw

If you want to run it faster, use the bf compiler:

  $ ../../parrot -j bfc.imc cw.bf < cw.txt > cw.c
