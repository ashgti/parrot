=head1 NAME

PAST - A high-level abstract syntax tree for Punie.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Punie compiler progresses through two levels of syntax tree. PAST
(Parrot/Punie Abstract Syntax Tree) is a high-level tree, which closely
corresponds to the semantics of the language (though in a desugared
form). PAST::Node implements the abstract syntax tree nodes created by
the Punie compiler.
