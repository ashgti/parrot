This is a liberal Pod parser, intended to have the semantics checked and
document structure built by an appropriate actions file. See the file test.pod
for the syntax it can handle. It can be run with the '--target=parse' option,
to dump the parse tree:

  ../../parrot pod.pir --target=parse test.pod 


This parser mostly follows the specification in 'perlpodspec', with the
following exceptions:

  - It doesn't allow formatting codes to span multiple lines.

  - It doesn't allow headers or item names to span multiple lines.

  - It requires =cut at the end of a section of Pod, even at the end of the
    file.

  - It allows any Pod formatting within a =begin/=end section, with no special
    treatment. (The semantic handling may impose constraints.)

  - It doesn't truncate whitespace within a formatting code (leaving that up to
    the semantic handling).

  - No special parsing is done for L<> codes (leaving that up to the formatter).

The current actions file is a no-op, simply returning the parse tree (but left
in place because HLLCompiler apparently can't handle a null actions file).

The 'make test' target does nothing.
