	* Use improved imcc syntax where possible
	* more tests
	* changed substitution macro mess to pcc sub mess

	* use improved imcc sub-calling syntax everywhere

		string (partial), array (partial)
  	* [set] now deals with unknown variables properly
 	* support for array variables 
	* builtin channels, e.g. [puts stderr eek]

2004-05-14
	* generate examples/Makefile at config time
	* updated to use new test suite.
	* refactored parser/interpreter (slight speed improvement,
	  needed for upcoming compiler)

2004-05-28
        * put all user-visible procs into "Tcl" namespace, especially
          user-defined procedures.
        * put all interpreter-only procs into "_Tcl" namespace
        * factor out non-tclsh-specific setup into lib/tcllib.imc
        * first cut at: $P1 = compreg "TCL"
        * switch all procs in the "Tcl" namespace to use normal calling
          conventions. (That is, don't foldup arguments before calling,
          pass in variable arguments where necessary for interoperability)
        * [expr sqrt()] now uses the (new) sqrt op.
