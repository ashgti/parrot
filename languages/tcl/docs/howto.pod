=head1 contributing to tcl/parrot

a brief overview on how to help out, if you're interested. In general, 
it's ok to send patches for tcl to the RT system for anything that isn't
"BIG STUFF" - those, please bounce off me first. I'd prefer C<diff -u>
patches, but am happy to take complete files as well.

Most of this is mentioned in the TODO - in fact, this document probably
should merge with the TODO to avoid redundancy.

Since partcl is bundled with the parrot source, svn access is handled via
the same mechanism as for parrot itself.

=item compiler bits

partcl is a compiler. Given a section of tcl code, it translates that code
into an AST (in the form of a Tcl* object from lib/*). Once a section of code
has been translated, the object's C<compile> method is invoked, which then
generates PIR which can be compiled by parrot.

When writing a new builtin, preferentially put it in
C<< lib/builtins/<builtin>.pir >> , and follow the conventions for that
directory. C<tcl.pl> will automatically generate a version in commands/ that
invokes the inline'able version, compiles it, invokes it, and returns
the result. The compiler will fall back to this version as necessary.

Inlined builtins must take a register num to begin with, along with a single
PMC with the various args. (As opposed to the interpreted-style, which takes
a vararg list.). They must return the register in which the result of the
command is stored, along with the generated PIR. The results of calling
the inlined code will be used by C<lib/tclcommand.pir>. The inlined code
is further wrapped in a protective conditional which will skip
the inlined version if it can no longer be trusted (that is, if [proc]
or [rename] has been invoked), and will fall back to
the interpreted version as necessary. (And throw an exception if the command
is not found at runtime.)

=item speed

We're currently slow, compared to tclsh. It's not worth worrying about
this in terms of specific numbers until we can run C<tcltest> natively. That
said, any patches that improve speed without harming maintainability will of
course be applied.

=item features

We're currently missing some things that require support from parrot. See
L<hacks.pod> for a list. In general, though, a lot of what we need to do is
possible with parrot.

If you're looking for something to todo, check one of:

Every builtin at L<http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/contents.htm>
should have a corresponding file in C<lib/builtins/>

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

=over 4

=item pod

Every PIR .sub that's defined should probably have some POD to go along
with it to document the arguments and return values. Only exceptions to
this should be subs which correspond directly to Tcl builtins -- those
are already documented elsewhere.

=item big picture docs.

Are the docs in C<docs/> useful? Could use someone to proof them, and
verify that there are no missing chunks (if missing, write them, or 
get them added to the C<TODO>), and that they are coherent.

=item Missing Commands

Every builtin command corresponds to a file with an appropriately named
sub in C<lib/commands> - Each of these subs takes some number of PMCs
as arguments. For those commands that take a fixed number of parameters,
we declare them with C<.param>. For those that take a variable number,
we use the C<foldup> opcode.

If the return value would be TCL_OK, then simply C<.return> the value
from the sub. For any other return type, use one of the macros in 
C<lib/returncodes.pir>: C<.throw>, etc. the value can be any simple
register or a PMC, the calling conventions will autobox as necessary.

Before adding new functionality, add a test (or a test in an existing) file 
in C<t/> - tests for C<puts>, for example, go in C<t/cmd_puts.t> - 
we use the C<Test::Harness> framework, via C<Parrot::Test>. 

Our final goal will be to pass (most of) the tcl test suite: run 
C<make tcl-test> to checkout the latest version of of the tcl test suite
and run it. Warning: slow...

Long term goal is remove any tests in C<t/> that are testing things
that are already tested in the official tcl suite.
Partcl's checked in test suite should just
be checking partcl-specific functionaliity.
