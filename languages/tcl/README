=head1 ParTcl

A from scratch implementation of Tcl on Parrot.

To build the tcl interpreter, first build parrot.  From the top level
parrot directory:

 perl Configure.pl && make

Then, type C<make> in this directory. This will
generate the file C<tcl.pbc> which can then be used to run tcl programs.

 ../../parrot tcl.pbc foo.tcl

=head2 Interactive tclsh

To run ParTcl interactively, simply type:

 make tclsh

in this directory.

=head2 Command line options

partcl supports two command line options (that are B<not> standard Tcl):

=over 4

=item -e

Analagous to perl's C<-e> switch, this option will let you specify tcl
code in the command line, which will then be executed. e.g:

 $ ../../parrot tcl.pbc -e="puts {Hello World}"
 Hello World

=item --pir

Given this option, partcl will compile the tcl code to PIR, and output
the PIR on STDOUT. This PIR can then be compiled to parrot bytecode, or
run directly through parrot. (Works with C<-e>.)

=head2 Examples

To run an example, change to the C<examples>, and type C<make>
for instructions. Running examples from here automatically handles
cd'ing to the proper directory to run.

=head2 Test Suite

To run the test suite, type C<make test>. Note - if I<any> tests fail, try
setting the environment variable C<TEST_PROG_ARGS> to C<-G> and retry.

If any tests fail (with C<-G> or not), please email the perl6-internals list.
