All TODO items should be documented in RT (http://rt.perl.org/) 
or the test suite (t/*.t)

A listing of all RT TODO items is available at:

 http://rt.perl.org/rt3/NoAuth/parrot/List.html?Field=Lang&Value=tcl

To add TODOs to this list (which is powered by RT), send an email to

 parrotbugs@parrotcode.org

Begin your subject with '[TODO]' so that the bug is automatically marked as a
TODO ticket.  For reasons of consistency, the encouraged format of the subject
line is:

'[TODO] Tcl - <summary of task>'

Note that while TODO automatically makes it a TODO, Tcl doesn't automatically
assign it to tcl - this needs to be set in RT, under the section
"Custom Fields". If you can't set this, don't worry: one of the bugadmins
will eventually get to it.
