Milestones
----------

This is a rough list of the major components to be added to Rakudo
over the next few months:

* list context, list assignment
* return and control exceptions
* class, role, objects
* regex, token, rule, grammar
* selected libraries written in Perl 6
* modules
* junctions
* hyper, reduction operators
* lazy lists
* slices
* multi sub & multi-method dispatch
* captures and signature handling
* currying
* operator overloading
* other S09 features (typed arrays, sized types)
* heredocs
* macros
* module versioning

The list above also gives a sense of the rough prioritization
of things -- i.e., getting return and control exceptions to work
is a higher priority than heredocs or macros.  But it's also
not intended to be rigid nor strictly sequential -- it's okay
for people to work on some of the later milestones even if the
earlier ones aren't complete.
