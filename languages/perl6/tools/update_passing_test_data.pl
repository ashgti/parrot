=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool runs the same test that C<make spectest> would, except those that
C<make spectest> runs.

For each file that passes at least one test (criterion might change in future)
it prints out a short summary about the status of this file.

This is primarily used to identify tests that could be added to
F<t/spectest.data>, and those that are worth a closer look. But
please don't add them blindly just because they all pass - chances are that
there's a good reason for them not already being included.

This script should be called from the main Rakudo directory (ie
C<languages/perl6/> relative to parrot).
