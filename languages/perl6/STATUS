This is a laundry list of things completed and items on the "to do" list:

Compiler implemented
--------------------
* Very basic expressions and operators
* Listop parsing and execution
* Simplified quoted strings
* if, unless
* infix:and, infix:or, infix:&&, infix:||, ternary:?? !!

Compiler to-do
--------------
* blocks
* subs
* variables
* resolve handling of unicode-encoded source on systems w/o ICU

Parser implemented
------------------
* Common if, while statements
* Basic blocks
* Perl 6 comments (excluding POD)
* List associative operators

Parser to-do
------------
* POD comments
* Long dot comments
* statement modifier operators
* real pointy subs
* subroutine definitions
* subroutine calling syntax
* variables
* "use" statement
* statement labels
* real quoted strings

Small patches are preferred over large ones.  Send
patches to the <perl6-compiler@perl.org> mailing list.


PIR notes:

* The PIR code generated for chained operators isn't all that
  efficient -- the execution path goes through a number of
  unnecessary "unless $Pxx goto label" steps.

* Currently basic blocks are being inlined into code,
  in order to properly support lexicals each block will need
  to become its own .sub (or at least have the capability to
  do so).
