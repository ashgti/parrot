This is a laundry list of things completed and items on the "to do" list:

Compiler implemented
--------------------
* basic expressions and operators
* listop parsing and execution
* simplified quoted strings
* if, unless statements
* if, unless statement modifiers
* chained operators: infix:and, infix:or, infix:&&, infix:||, ternary:?? !!
* lexical and package-scoped scalars
* simple blocks
* numeric literals 0x, 0b, 0d, 0o, numbers w/underscores
* string to numeric conversion
* scalar interpolation in strings

Compiler to-do
--------------
* interpolate closures
* generalized quotes
* subs
* arrays, hashes
* resolve handling of unicode-encoded source on systems w/o ICU
* :2<...>, :8<...>, radix conversions

Parser implemented
------------------
* Common while, unless statements
* Basic blocks
* Perl 6 comments (including POD, long dot)
* List associative operators
* statement modifier operators
* POD comments
* interpolation of scalar variables

Parser to-do
------------
* fix long-dot comments to new S02 syntax
* fix parsing of if-block
* interpolate closures
* generalized quote interpolation
* real pointy subs
* subroutine definitions
* subroutine calling syntax
* variables
* "use" statement
* statement labels
* real quoted strings
* :2<...>, :8<...>, etc. radix conversion
