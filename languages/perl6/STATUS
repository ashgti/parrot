This is a laundry list of things completed and items on the "to do" list:

Compiler implemented
--------------------
* basic expressions and operators
* listop parsing and execution
* simplified quoted strings
* if, unless statements
* if, unless statement modifiers
* chained operators: infix:and, infix:or, infix:&&, infix:||, ternary:?? !!
* simple scalar variables (but not lexically scoped yet)

Compiler to-do
--------------
* blocks
* subs
* true lexicals
* arrays, hashes
* resolve handling of unicode-encoded source on systems w/o ICU

Parser implemented
------------------
* Common while, unless statements
* Basic blocks
* Perl 6 comments (including POD, long dot)
* List associative operators
* statement modifier operators

Parser to-do
------------
* POD comments
* real pointy subs
* subroutine definitions
* subroutine calling syntax
* variables
* "use" statement
* statement labels
* real quoted strings

Small patches are preferred over large ones.  Send
patches to the <perl6-compiler@perl.org> mailing list.


PIR notes:

* The PIR code generated for chained operators isn't all that
  efficient -- the execution path goes through a number of
  unnecessary "unless $Pxx goto label" steps.

* Currently basic blocks are being inlined into code,
  in order to properly support lexicals each block will need
  to become its own .sub (or at least have the capability to
  do so).
