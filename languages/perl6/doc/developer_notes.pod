=head1 Developer's Notes

=head2 Purpose

This document is a shared notebook for developers working on the
prototype Perl 6 compiler. It's a place to record observations,
obstacles, solutions, plans, etc. It's not generally intended for
people who are just using the compiler, but if you run across a
feature that doesn't quite work, you may find it mentioned here.

=head2 Compiling

At the moment, P6C will only work if you configure parrot with
the icudatadir specified:

  perl Configure.pl --icudatadir="`pwd`/blib/lib/icu/2.6.1"

or equivalent.

=head2 Subroutines

I'm having a problem with user-defined subroutines. Subroutines
without any defined parameters work fine (arguments are passed in @_).
Subroutines with one defined parameter get 1 as the value of the
parameter. With two defined parameters, the first has the value 2, the
second is a NULL PMC.

I haven't had time to look into it further, but I added SKIP tests
that demonstrate the problem(s) in t/subs/simple.t. --Allison
