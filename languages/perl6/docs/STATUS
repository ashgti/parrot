This is a laundry list of things completed and items on the
"to do soon" list:

Compiler implemented
--------------------
* basic expressions and operators
* listop parsing and execution
* if, unless statements
* if, unless statement modifiers
* while, until and repeat statements
* chained operators
* infix:and, infix:or, infix:&&, infix:||
* lexical and package-scoped scalars
* simple blocks
* numeric literals 0x, 0b, 0d, 0o, numbers w/underscores
* string to numeric conversion
* scalar interpolation in strings
* simple subroutines
* arity-based multi subs
* simple for loops and iterators
* arrays and hashes
* Perl 6 comments
* unspace
* list quoting (<a b c>)
* try blocks w/o CATCH
* BEGIN, END blocks
* pointy subs
* named parameters
* optional parameters
* slurpy parameters
* named arguments
* fat arrow syntax to make a pair
* some colonpair syntaxes to make pairs (:a, :!a, :$a, :a(...))
* smart match syntax, and some classes provide match functionality
* given statement
* creation of junctions (operator and functional versions)
* auto-threading of some operations on junctions
* classes
* attributes with accessor generation
* methods
* inheritance
* roles
* role composition
* named regexes
* defining refinement types using the subset keyword
* @*ARGS
* $*IN, $*OUT, $*ERR
* open function for getting a file handle; supports some open modes
* .say, .print and .close methods on file handles
* iterating over file handles
* conditional modifier + loop modifier
* grammars
* postcircumfix:<> for colonpairs
* WHAT, HOW, WHENCE
* .perl method on junctions, Num, Int and Str


To do
-----
* Start using .HLL, including mapping of types
* give named rules and tokens the correct semantics
* type-based multi-subs and multi-methods
* explicit specification of invocant in methods
* $?LINE and $?FILE
* self!method() and $x!method() and private methods generally
* is rw trait on attributes
* anonymous classes
* junction auto-threading
