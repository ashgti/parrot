This directory contains some tests for Sean O'Rourke's
Perl 6 parser.

All the tests are in .t files.
Input Perl6 programs are in .pl files.
Expected parse tree is in .exp files.

Just run the tests like any other perl program.
Or type "make tests".

All the tests take the following optional parameters:
   --grammar FOO
      - Loads the grammer called FOO.pm
      - If not specified, uses Perl6grammar.pm
   --force
      - The grammar is created at runtime.  Slow!
   --verbose
      - Prints info about the test, including timing data.
   --dump
      - Dumps the programs used in the tests.
      - Each program is wrapped in a block ... ie. {}
      - This is useful when you want to cat these
        programs together to make a big mother program
        (to gather timing info)

The test speed.t allows you to specify on the command
line a list of .pgm files to time.  E.g.
    perl speed.t --verbose exe4*.pl similar*.pl

Hav fun!
