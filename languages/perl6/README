=head1 Perl 6 on Parrot

This is the Perl 6 compiler for Parrot, called "perl6".  It's still
fairly primitive -- only simple expressions and functions are
available, but it's rapidly expanding.  See L<docs/STATUS> for a
list of what has been implemented thus far.

=head2 Building and invoking perl6

To build the compiler, start by building Parrot, then change
to the languages/perl6/ subdirectory and type "make".  This
will create the compiler as a file called "perl6.pbc".  The ".pbc"
stands for "Parrot bytecode", and represents an executable Parrot
module.

To run a Perl 6 program with perl6, issue a command like

    $ parrot perl6.pbc hello.pl

As of this writing, we don't yet have a way to simply execute
Perl 6 programs with a command like "perl6 hello.pl", nor to
automatically invoke perl6 on scripts that start with a "#!" line.
However, this is an high priority -- see RT#49168.

If the perl6 compiler is invoked without an explicit script to
run -- i.e., as "parrot perl6.pbc", it enters a small interactive
mode that allows Perl 6 statements to be executed from the
command line.

=head2 Running the test suite

Entering "make test" will run the test suite that comes bundled
with perl6 on Parrot.  This is a simple suite of tests, designed
to make sure that the perl6 compiler is basically working and that
it's capable of running a simple test harness.

Running "make spectest" will import relevant portions of the
"official Perl 6 test suite" from the Pugs repository
(http://svn.pugscode.org/tests/spec/) and run selected tests from
there.  At present we do not have any plans to directly store the
official test suite as part of the Parrot repository.

=head2 Reporting bugs

Bug reports should be sent to C<perl6-bugs@perl.org> with the
moniker [BUG] (including the brackets) at the start of the subject
so that it gets appropriately tagged in the RT system.  Please include
or attach any sample source code that exhibits the bug, and if appropriate
identify the svn revision number of the code that you're working
from.  There's no need to cc: the perl6-compiler mailing list, as
the RT system will handle this on its own.

=head2 Submitting patches

If you have a patch that fixes a bug or adds a new feature, please
submit it to C<perl6-bugs@perl.org> with the moniker [PATCH]
(including the brackets) at the start of the subject line.  We'll
generally accept patches in any form if we can get them to work,
but unified diff from the svn command is greatly preferred.  In
general this means you can execute "svn diff >foo.patch" from
the languages/perl6/ directory and just attach the foo.patch file.

=head2 How the compiler works

Information about how the compiler works (and how one can learn
to hack on it) will be coming in a separate documentation file.
For the most part we expect people to be able to write compiler
code in Perl 6, with only minimal knowledge of PIR or other
portions of the Parrot compiler tool suite.
