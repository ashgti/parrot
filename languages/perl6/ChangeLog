=========

Additions:
- anonymous subs (requires hacked IMCC)
- implicit parameters (e.g. "$^a") (requires hacked IMCC)
- hyper-concatenation ("^_")
- perl-y functions: print, warn, die, exit
- loop
- foreach
- global variables (requires hacked IMCC)
- assignment to array slices

Fixes:
- misc context / flattening fixes.
- tests stop on SIGINT
- want-rule for no-arg prototypes
- reorg: moved some val() functions from IMCC.pm to IMCC/*.pm, to be
  loaded with SelfLoader when needed.  Trying to cut down startup time.
- needed to be cloning PMC's instead of just setting
- syntax in TestCompiler.pm

Test failures:
- foreach 1 (register clobbering)
- foreach 2 (maybe register clobbering)
