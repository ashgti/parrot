2002-07-??    (Parrot 0.0.7)

	* Initial CVS revision, modified from "V.00I_0I" on
	  perl6-internals.
	* Patches: (John Kingsley)
	    - squashed a warning in maybe_comma
	    - empty statements
	    - "foo::bar()" being treated as a label, "foo:".
	    - reset parser state between multiple parses.

2002-07-21

	* Additions:
	    - anonymous subs (requires hacked IMCC)
	    - implicit parameters (e.g. "$^a") (requires hacked IMCC)
	    - hyper-concatenation ("^_")
	    - perl-y functions: print, warn, die, exit
	    - loop
	    - foreach
	    - global variables (requires hacked IMCC)
	    - assignment to array slices

	* Fixes:
	    - misc context / flattening fixes.
	    - tests stop on SIGINT
	    - want-rule for no-arg prototypes
	    - reorg: moved some val() functions from IMCC.pm to IMCC/*.pm,
	      to be loaded with SelfLoader when needed.  Trying to cut
	      down startup time.
	    - needed to be cloning PMC's instead of just setting
	    - syntax in TestCompiler.pm

	* Test-failures:
	    - foreach 1 (register clobbering)
	    - foreach 2 (maybe register clobbering)

2002-07-23

	* Additions:
	    - try { ... } and CATCH { ... } (via the amazing callcc!)

	* Fixes:
	    - Changes to work with 5.005_03 (thanks Leopold Toetsch):
		- remove the naughty word 'our'
		- remove lvalue sub 'code'
		- remove /x modifier from qr regexen in Parser.pm -- 5.005
		  doesn't handle them correctly.
	    - appropriate use of clone to avoid nasty aliasing.

	* Test-failures:
	    - 5.5 (flattening) --  Currently under investigation.
	    - qsort.t -- I suspect funky spilling, but also under
	      investigation.

2002-07-23-B

	* Additions:
	    - test for increment.

	* Fixes:
	    - get cloning right.
	    - use Test::Harness instead of shell to glob tests

	* Test-failures:
	    - with the right version of IMCC, all compiler tests pass!
	    - (parser tests disabled waiting for the error-message patch
	      to stabilize)

2002-07-24

	* Additions:
	    - parser error messages (John Kingsley)
	    - more parser tests (Kingsley) NOTE: these will generate
	      "uninitialized value" warnings, but they are harmless.

2002-07-25

	* Additions:
	    - "clean" and "distclean" Makefile targets (Leopold Toetsch).
	    - test-* files from different test don't clobber each other
	      (Toetsch).

2002-07-27

	* Additions:
	    - new driver program, "perl6" (Leopold Toetsch)
	    - mops.p6 performance test (Toetsch) (depressing)

	* Fixes:
	    - grammar uninitialized value warnings (John Kingsley)

2002-07-28

	* Additions:
	    - simple given/when cases.
	    - labels, loop control (e.g. "next")
	    - goto (considered harmful).

	    Note that this control flow is _not_ the "control flow
	    exceptions" mentioned in Apocalypse 4, but more standard
	    control flow with jumps.  As such, it doesn't play nicely with
	    exceptions.  If you jump out of a block with a CATCH clause,
	    you will lose somewhere down the road.

	* Fixes:
	    - underscores in numbers.
	    - block in sub resetting sub parameter list
	    - inplace operators (e.g. +=)
	    - bug in time0

	* Test-failures:
	    - 8.3 (Exceptions) -- stack is messed up.  Probably a P6C bug,
	      since the exception stuff is a bit fragile still.

2002-08-01

	* Additions:
	    - line numbers (Leo Toetsch)

	* Fixes:
	    - driver cleanup (Toetsch)

2002-08-04

	    - minor test additions (Leo Toetsch)

2002-08-05

	* Fixes:

2002-08-07

	* Fixes:
	    - clean up bitrot in parser tests (Leo Toetsch)

2002-08-09

	* Fixes:
	    - clean up throw/CATCH (Leo -- a good use for weird
	      Continuation objects)

	* Additions:
	    - @ARGS, at last.

2002-08-10

	* Additions (Leo):
	    - corrected @ARGS, $0, $PROGRAM_NAME
	    - use real pow op

	* Broken (me, probably):
	    - "$x = @xs" will leave $x undefined.
	
2002-08-19

	* Additions:
	    - return values (documentation coming).
	    - pconfig.pl extracts lib extension from Makefile (Leo)
	    - perl6 (Leo)
	        - new options, including support for --shared native -C
		- some doc

	* Fixes:
	    - perl6 (Leo)

	        - use libparrot.a for -C
	
	* Test-failures:
	    - 3.{2,4-7}, a.2 -- register clobbering.
	    - 8.3 -- not sure

2002-08-20

	* Additions:
	    - first cut at regexes.  Very rough, but it's fun to play
	      with.
	
	* Fixes:
	    - "f($x)" and "f $x" now behave as expected when f is declared
	      with a prototype.
	    - allow comma-separated expressions in "loop(;;)"
	    - docs and tweaks for perl6 driver (Leo)

2002-08-22

	* Additions:
	    - more exception tests (Leo).
	
	* Fixes:
	    - maybe_comma tweaks (Leo).
	    - remove debugging warning.
	    - cloning cleanup (Leo).
	    - less temporaries for a couple assignments (Leo).
	    - context for sub-calls with parens was wrong.

2002-08-23

	* Fixes:
	    - no-arg subs were failing with '()'.

2002-08-24
	
	* Additions:
	    - substr() and length() (Leo).
	    - examples: life, mandel, life-ar (Leo).
	    - examples/qsort.p6
	    - $::RD_NO_HITEM and $::RD_NO_TRACE on by default
	    - t/rx -- regex tests (basic.t for now)
	    - '!~' to go with '=~'

	* Fixes:
	    - make sure keywords don't match prefixes of sub names.
	    - better handling of returns to various contexts using
	      standard functions (TYPE_in_context()).
	    - tidied up examples.
	    - repetition specifiers can be mixed vars and literals.
	
	* Test-failures:
	    - none.  That's right.  None (on Linux/PPC, w/imcc patch).

2002-08-25

	* Additions:
	    - t/rx/special.t -- escape sequences
	    - better regex documentation

	* Fixes:
	    - disabled parser tests
	    - escaped char parsing
	    - misc regex compiling bugs

2002-08-26

	* Additions:
	    - t/rx/call.t -- rule call

	    - driver tidying and doc-update (Leo).
