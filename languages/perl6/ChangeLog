Parrot 0.0.7
============

- Initial CVS revision, modified from "V.00I_0I" on perl6-internals.
- Grammar patches (John Kingsley):
  - squashed a warning in maybe_comma
  - empty statements
  - "foo::bar()" being treated as a label, "foo:".
  - reset parser state between multiple parses.

7/21/2002
=========

Additions:
- anonymous subs (requires hacked IMCC)
- implicit parameters (e.g. "$^a") (requires hacked IMCC)
- hyper-concatenation ("^_")
- perl-y functions: print, warn, die, exit
- loop
- foreach
- global variables (requires hacked IMCC)
- assignment to array slices

Fixes:
- misc context / flattening fixes.
- tests stop on SIGINT
- want-rule for no-arg prototypes
- reorg: moved some val() functions from IMCC.pm to IMCC/*.pm, to be
  loaded with SelfLoader when needed.  Trying to cut down startup time.
- needed to be cloning PMC's instead of just setting
- syntax in TestCompiler.pm

Test failures:
- foreach 1 (register clobbering)
- foreach 2 (maybe register clobbering)

7/23/02
=======

Additions:
- try { ... } and CATCH { ... } (via the amazing callcc!)

Fixes:
- Changes to work with 5.005_03 (thanks Leopold Toetsch):
  - remove the naughty word 'our'
  - remove lvalue sub 'code'
  - remove /x modifier from qr regexen in Parser.pm -- 5.005 doesn't
    handle them correctly.
- appropriate use of clone to avoid nasty aliasing.

Test failures:
- 5.5 (flattening) --  Currently under investigation.
- qsort.t -- I suspect funky spilling, but also under investigation.

7/23/02 B
=========

Additions:
- test for increment.

Fixes:
- get cloning right.
- use Test::Harness instead of shell to glob tests

Test failures:
- with the right version of IMCC, all compiler tests pass!
- (parser tests disabled waiting for the error-message patch to stabilize)

7/24/02
=======

Additions:
- parser error messages (John Kingsley)
- more parser tests (Kingsley) NOTE: these will generate
  "uninitialized value" warnings, but they are harmless.
