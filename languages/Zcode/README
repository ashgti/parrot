ZiPIR - Z-machine in PIR

v0.2

The program z3.imc translates version 3 Z-code files into PIR, the compiles
and runs that PIR. In other words, it's a fancy Z-machine interpreter.

Run it like:
	parrot z3.pir [-debug] minizork.z3

(Except it won't actually work on minizork. Yet.)

Right now, the only sample programs are a hello world and a concise
version of the test script. Be patient.


TESTS:
	cd languages/Zcode
	make test (or perl t/harness)

A lot. See the TODO file.
