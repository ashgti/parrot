From Pat Eyler:
Actually, cardinal was not the first Ruby on Parrot attempt
I wrote a very small subset of Ruby on Parrot called Rabbit in 2000
at the time, Parrot had no object support, so I was limited to string 
and numeric 'objects' and a small set of operators that posed as methods.
Sadly, there is no extant copy of the code.

Phil Tomson created the first version of Cardinal.
