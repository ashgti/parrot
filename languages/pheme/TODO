Atom:
	- create atom object
	- add subtypes for string, number, etc.?

Cons:
	- fix cons count for empty cons?

Builtins:
	- consider if eq? and eqlist? should really be multis
		- add varieties for mismatched parameters if not
	- refactor is_deeply() and is() in Pheme::Test
		- add diagnostics too, if possible
	- add nil?
	- fix car on empty cons

Special forms:
	- cond
	- lambda (be careful of define interaction though!)
	- else
	- and
	- or

Compiler:
	- extract and merge POST improvements with Punie
		- publish them under compilers/
		- share those nodes somehow
	- port to new TGE, when the branch lands
	- fix load_bytecode section in generated code
	- refactor compiler backend object
		- share with Perl 6 and Punie
		- move somewhere in Parrot lib path
		- allow dumping of trees and (runnable) PIR
	- use precompiled tree grammars
	- merge all PBC files into pheme.pbc

Fix namespace:
	- lowercase
	- directly under Parrot root
	- use nested namespaces properly

Grammar:
	- tighten identifiers
		- allow ! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @ ^ _ ~ 
		- start with any non-number-beginning character
		- . + - not allowed at the start of an identifier
		- + - themselves can be an identifier
		- ... can be an identifier
	- fix whitespace
		- space, newline (also tab, carriage return)
	- parse numbers
		- . + - allowed at the start of a number
	- add more rules
		- \ is an escape character

Predicates:
	- boolean?
		- everything but #f is true (conditionals, not true here)
	- symbol?
	- char?
	- vector?
	- procedure?
	- pair?
	- number?
	- string?
	- port?
	- predicates are disjoint
	- empty list satisfies none


The following tickets were stored in parrot's RT system.

They have now been marked as rejected in that system, but are listed
here for posterity, so they can easily be migrated into pheme's new
ticketing system, whatever that may be.
