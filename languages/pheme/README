This is Pheme, version 0.1.0
----------------------------

Copyright (C) 2006 - 2007, Parrot Foundation.

Pheme is a Parrot-based implementation of Scheme, in the sense that it has the
same syntax (what syntax it has) and shares the name of some built-ins.  Please
note the version number.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Pheme depends on Parrot 0.4.13 or higher, PGE, and TGE.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Get Parrot.  Compile Parrot.  Make sure its tests pass, particularly those of
PGE and TGE.

Compile Pheme:

  $ make
  $ make test

Note that the tests are actual Pheme programs, written entirely in Pheme
(except for the test library, which is a PIR program).

Run the Pheme compiler via Parrot.  The first argument to the compiler should
be a Pheme program to run.

  $ parrot pheme.pbc some_program.pheme

Read the TODO file for an idea of some ways to improve this language.

Please send all patches, bug reports, and suggestions to the Parrot mailing
list.
