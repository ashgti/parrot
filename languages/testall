=head1 languages harness

There are 3 ways to run a language test: 

=over 4

=item * Overall Harness

C<cd languages && make test>

=item * Per Language Harness

e.g., C<cd languages/tcl && make test>

=item * Run a single test for more detailed output.

e.g., C<cd languages/tcl && t/joe_test.t>

=for comment

We are assuming that we are running out of parrot/languages; we are being
called by languages/Makefile with an explicit perl. All languages have 
a Makefile with a "test" target, and any prereqs required by that test
have already been built.

# Step 1: find harness files for testable languages

# These could all be tested:
#
# BASIC                No t/harness
# befunge              No t/harness
# bf                   No t/harness
# cola                 No t/harness
# conversion           No t/harness
# forth                No t/harness
# jako                 No t/harness
# lisp                 No t/harness
# miniperl             No t/harness
# ook                  No t/harness
# parakeet             No t/harness
# perl6                t/harness has no --files
# python
