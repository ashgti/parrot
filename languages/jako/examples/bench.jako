# only substantive differences between the Java version and the
# Jako version are:
#
#   * 'var int ...' vs 'int ...' for variable declaration.
#
#   * The commented-out print line (which is simpler in Jako).
#
#   * The use of the named constant N (value 100) instead of
#     the literal constant 10000 in the conditions of the while
#     loops.
