=head1 NAME

languages/python/t/harness - A harness for Parrot python

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cd languages && perl python/t/harness -files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Conformant to a recent post on p6i, if I'm called with a single
argument of "-files", I just return a list of files to process.
This list is one per line, and is relative to the languages dir.

If I'm called with no args, I run all tests.

Otherwise I try to run list of passed tests.

if ( grep { /^-files$/ } @ARGV )
{
  # I must be running out of languages/
  my $dir = File::Spec->catfile( $language, 't' );
  my @files = glob( File::Spec->catfile( $dir, '*/*.t' ) );
  print join( "\n", @files );
  print "\n" if scalar(@files);
}
else
{
  my @files;
  if ( scalar(@ARGV) )
  {
    # Someone specified tests for me to run.
    @files = grep { -f $_ } @ARGV
  }
  else
  {
    # I must be running out of languages/$language
    # You may want a deeper search than this.
    @files = glob( "t/*/*.t" );
  }
  runtests( @files ) if scalar(@files);
}
