        - new file debug.pasm that will handle all the debugging
          capabilities of the interpreter.
        - the verbose flag (-v) is replaced with a debug flag (-d) to
          activate the integrated debugger.

        - now using the push and pop instructions of the PerlArray
          PMC, and thanks go to Steve Fink for his hack to pop an
          empty PerlArray.

	- original version.
        - every instruction is implemented, and tested.
        - input instructions ( '&' and '~') are kinda buggy.
        - a "verbose" flag (-v) can help you debug your Befunge code
          (as if it were hard to debug Befunge - pfff! :o) )
