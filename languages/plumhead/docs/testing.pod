Plumhead - Testing

=head1 Testsuite

For testing the test-suite from a current PHP release is used.
For sanity checking there are also very few tests in
F<languages/plumhead/t/php>. These are used by 'make test'.

The PMC implementations are checked in F<t/pmc>

=head1 How to run the PHP test suite

A problem are relative paths used by both the PHP test suite and
by the generated PIR. Something like this worked for me under Linux.

  cd ~/devel/Parrot/trunk
  perl Configure.pl && make
  cd ~/devel/PHP/php-5.2.0
  ./configure && make
  ln -s ../../Parrot/trunk/parrot
  ln -s ../../Parrot/trunk/languages
  export PATH=.:$PATH
  export TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=languages/plumhead/plumhead.pl
  export TEST_PHP_CGI_EXECUTABLE=languages/plumhead/plumhead.pl
  export PLUMHEAD_VARIANT=phc
  php run-tests.php -v --keep-all -r languages/plumhead/t/selection.txt | tee run-tests.log
  
Good luck.
