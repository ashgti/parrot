Implementation of 'POSIX bc' with the help Python code created from
an ANTLR grammar.

Requirements:

For development ANTLR 2.7.5, and thus Java, is required.
The runtime files for Lexer and Parser are in the Parror SVN, thus only
python is required for running.

Building:

'make help'

Testing:

'make test'. When GNU bc is available, the test suite will be run against GNU bc as well.
