This in an implementation of 'POSIX bc' with the help of Python classes created from
an ANTLR grammar.

Requirements:

For development ANTLR 2.7.5, and thus Java, is required.
The runtime files for Lexer and Parser are in the Parror SVN, thus only
python is required for running.

Building lexer, parser and treeparser:

'make maintain'

Building:

'make help'

Testing:

'make test'. When GNU bc is available, the test suite will be run against GNU bc as well.
For compatability with 'POSIX bc' the flags '--standard' and '--quiet' are used.

Strategy:

Generate PIR that sets up a PAST data structure, that will be executed by
whatever will executes Punie.
