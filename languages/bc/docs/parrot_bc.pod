=head1 Overview

This is an implementation of 'POSIX bc' for Parrot.
'bc' is an arbitrary precision calculator dating back from Unix stone age.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_%28Unix%29 for details.
This implementation is based on Python classes generated by ANTLR.

=head1 Why Parrot bc

Self education. A fairly simple language but has symbols and subroutines.
Test for decimal bignum libraries.
A starting point for more interesting languages like R, GDL, JavaScript.

=head1 Parrot bc with ANTLR 2

Develoment has stalled.

The language grammar is in grammar/bc_python.g. ANTLR2 takes the grammar and
generates Python classes for lexer, parser and tree parser.
The driver program bc.py takes bc source and generates PIR.
The generated PIR sets up a PAST data structure, and from there on Allison Randalls 
TGE takes over.

=head2 Parrot bc with ANTLR 3

Under development.

Generate PIR that sets up a PAST data structure, that will be transformed to POST
which will be transformed to PIR, which will be  executed by Parrot.
For details set 'languages/punie/punie.pir' and
http://svn.lohutok.net/nam/trunk/parrot/docs/compiler_tools.pod

=head1 Vision

Use the C# Backend, generate .NET EXE/DLL and run with languages/dotnet.
