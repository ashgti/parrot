=head1 Overview

This is an implementation of 'POSIX bc'. It is based on Python classes generated by ANTLR.

=head1 Why Parrot bc

Self education. A fairly simple language but has symbols and subroutines.
Test for decimal bignum libraries.
A starting point for more interesting languages like R, GDL.

=head2 Vision

Do the code generation like bc -> PIL -> PIR
Be compatible with Pirate and Pugs.
Switch to Perl6 after Gary Evans has made a Perl6 backend for ANTLR.
