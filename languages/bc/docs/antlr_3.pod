=head1 Overview

These are some rumblings on using ANTLR 3 for Parrot bc, or with Parrot in general.

=head1 Parsing in general

=head1 ANTLR 3

See http://www.antlr.org/v3/index.html.

=head2 Running

Bc.java needs to find the needed classes. This works for me:

  export ANTLR_HOME=/home/bernhard/devel/ANTLR/antlr-3
  export PARROT_HOME=/home/bernhard/devel/Parrot/repos/parrot
  export CLASSPATH=$ANTLR_HOME/lib/antlr-2.7.6.jar:$ANTLR_HOME/lib/antlr-3.0b3.jar:$ANTLR_HOME/lib/stringtemplate-2.3b9.jar:$PARROT_HOME/languages/bc/grammar/antlr_3:$PARROT_HOME/languages/bc 

And see the targest maintain-java, build-java, test-java in bc/Makefile.

=head2 Syntax

Lexer, Parser and TreeParser are in the same file, speak grammar.
C and C++ style comments are accepted.

'+' is one or many

'(  )' is for grouping
'|'    as for alternation 
"''"   Sring delimeter, honoring '\t', '\n', '\r'

'{   }' are actions
';'     delimits rules
'grammar <name>', set name of Parser, Name of autogenerated Lexer is generated from it

Tell to generate an AST
options 
{
    output=AST;
    ASTLabelType=CommonTree;
}

'Sigil $' is for referencing alternations in actions, Lexer items only ???, also for setting returns

'->' Is for tree construction
'^^' Makes a mother
'^' Is for matching of tree nodes
'[]' declaration and passing of parameters

@members  declare additional member variables in the parser class

@init   ??

scope   a stack for symbols
 
{
  channel = 99;
}
put match into Nirwana   
  

=head2 Lexer

The lexer specification can be in the parser specification.
A lexer grammar is automatically generated.
'protected' is gone.
