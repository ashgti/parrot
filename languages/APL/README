INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Compile APL to bytecode and run its test suite:

  $ make
  $ make test

Run the APL compiler via Parrot, passing it an APL source file to process:

  $ parrot APL.pbc demo.apl
  20
  5.5

Run the APL system interactively:

  $ parrot APL.pbc
      10Ã—2+3
  50

Display parse trees instead of executing statements:

  $ parrot APL.pbc --target=parse demo.apl

Display abstract syntax trees instead of executing statements:

  $ parrot APL.pbc --target=PAST demo.apl

Display the generated PIR code:

  $ parrot APL.pbc --target=PIR demo.apl

FONT: The source code for APL uses unicode codepoints that you might
not have a font for. If you can't read the code, try installing the
SimPL.tff font, available from:

  http://www.vector.org.uk/resource/simp2.htm

EDITOR: On OSX, I recommend SubEthaEdit for editing utf-8 encoded files. Also,
you'll want to enable the character palette: Go to System Preferences -> International -> Input Menu; enable 'Show input menu in menu bar'. To use the palette,
Click on the flag in the menu bar, select 'Character Palette'. A window will
pop up that lets you select unicode by code point, search by name of character,
insert into the open application, or bring up information about the selected
character.
