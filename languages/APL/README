This is APL**

APL is Copyright (C) 2006, The Perl Foundation.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Compile APL to bytecode and run its test suite:

  $ make
  $ make test

Run the APL compiler via Parrot, passing it the path to an APL
source file as the only argument: !!! At the moment, you have to run
APL from the top level parrot directory, as we're still punie-like in
that regard.

  $ ./parrot languages/APL/APL.pbc demo.p1

** This isn't APL at the moment, it's merely a test at using unicode
operators with PGE/TGE

FONT: The source code for APL uses unicode codepoints that you might
not have a font for. If you can't read the code, try installing one
of the fonts listed at:
