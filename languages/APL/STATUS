Things to do:

- Update APLVector to handle at least 2-dimensional arrays.
  - properly print/display N dimensional arrays.

- Need more tests! More tests for each type of operand per operator.

- Add function declarations.

- Add selective specification {in perl: lvalues}

- Add bracket indexing. { in perl: $a[1] } { implement index operator first }

- clean up the tools/ script so non-generated code is moved into a .pir file.
