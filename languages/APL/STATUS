Current status:

Work in progress.

Things to do:

- Need more tests! More tests for each type of operand per operator.

- Add function declarations.

- implement an APLVector that knows its shape. Everything will be stored as
  a 1 dimensional array, indexed access will be computed. Eventually ponder
  more compact +/or faster implementations. (current code in src/pmc still
  only works with vectors)
 
- properly print/display N dimensional arrays.

- clean up the tools/ script so non-generated code is moved into a .pir file.
