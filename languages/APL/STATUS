Things to do:

o Update APLVector to handle at least 2-dimensional arrays. See core 
  "multiarray" for potentially reuse / subclassing. This now also
  includes character arrays.
  o properly print/display N dimensional arrays. 

o Need more tests! More tests for each type of operand per operator.

o Add function declarations.

o Add selective specification {in perl: lvalues}

o Add bracket indexing. { in perl: $a[1] } { implement index operator first }

o clean up the tools/ script so non-generated code is moved into a .pir file.
