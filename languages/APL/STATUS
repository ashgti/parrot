Current status:

Work in progress. Some test failures.

Things to do:

- re-implement string parsing

- re-implement numeric constants

- Need more tests! Add more tests to t/dyadic.t. Int * Float is alright, but
  need Int * Int and Float * Float.

- Any todo'd tests.

- Add function declarations.

- Add vectors (May involve re-doing how we handle strings, as from APL's
  point of view, strings are just vectors of characters)

- Add DOMAIN ERROR exceptions when trying to use certain operators on
  strings
