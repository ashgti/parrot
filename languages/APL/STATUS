Current status:

Work in progress.

Things to do:

- Need more tests! Add more tests to t/dyadic.t. Int * Float is alright, but
  need Int * Int and Float * Float.

- Any todo'd tests.

- Add function declarations.

- Add DOMAIN ERROR exceptions when trying to use certain operators on
  strings - Probably by using MMD with everything, and having Strings throw
  errors most of the time.

- Automatically generate *all* of our dispatch code at build time. This will
  allow us to handle argument ordering in :multi, and automatically generate
  the appropriate code for each of the scalar/vector operators with no issue.

- possibly separate out the scalar ops in the grammar to simplify the dispatch.
  (or just make our generating code smart enough to deal.)
