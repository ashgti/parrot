languages/regex: Compile regular expressions into optimized bytecode.

CURRENT STATUS
==============

It's probably very very buggy. The 're' style regular expressions are
less buggy, but also useless to anyone else because the supporting
code isn't in the tree (and probably never will be; if anything, I'll
merge it in with the rx code. Copies available on request, though.)

But worse, you can't tell if anything is broken, because with the
keyed support unavailable, my test harness doesn't work.

DEVELOPER NOTES
===============

If you make changes to Grammar.y, you'll need Parse::Yapp to
regenerate Grammar.pm. Run 'make' with no options to pass the correct
command-line parameters.
