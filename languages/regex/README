languages/regex: Compile regular expressions into optimized bytecode.

CURRENT STATUS
==============

This won't work very well without a couple of other patches that I'll
be sending to the list Real Soon Now.

Somewhat buggy. The 're' style regular expressions are less buggy, but
also useless to anyone else because the supporting code isn't in the
tree (and probably never will be; if anything, I'll merge it in with
the rx code. Copies available on request, though.)

Alternation does not work for complex expressions.

The test harness depends on more of those patches I talked about.

DEVELOPER NOTES
===============

If you make changes to Grammar.y, you'll need Parse::Yapp to
regenerate Grammar.pm. Run 'make' with no options to pass the correct
command-line parameters.
