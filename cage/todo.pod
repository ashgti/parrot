=head1 Parrot Cage Cleaners high-level goals

=head2 Enforcing coding standards, naming conventions, etc

=head2 Smoke testing on many platforms

=head2 Decreasing the amount of repeated code

=head2 Automated generation of C headers

This has started significantly with the F<headerizer.pl> program.
Right now, it extracts the function headers correctly, but now I
have to have it create the F<.h> files.

=head2 Improve low-level code quality

=head2 Creating automated code checking tools

=head2 Documenting function behavior and structure members

=head2 Developing coverage tools where they don't exist

=head2 Run on many different C compilers

Most of Andy's work right now is with GCC 4.2 on Linux.  We need
many more.

=head2 Run under splint
