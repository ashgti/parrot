This is a build directory for custom PMCs with a sample foo.pmc
providing the Foo pmc class.

1) edit/create your foo.pmc source (s. also classes/genclass.pl)

2) edit Makefile and append your pmc

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:blib/lib
$ make -s
$ make shared
$ make -C dynclasses

$ ./parrot dynclasses/dynfoo.pasm
ok 1
41
ok 2

4) If anything changes inside parrot don't forget:

$ make -C dynclasses clean
