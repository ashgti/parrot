This is a build directory for custom PMCs with a sample foo.pmc
providing the Foo pmc class.

1) edit/create your foo.pmc source (s. also classes/genclass.pl)

2) edit Makefile (or much better provide a script that generates
   a platform independent Makefile ;-)

$ make -s
$ make shared
$ make -C dynclasses

3) copy/link your extension to the runtime dir

$ cd runtime/parrot/dynext/
$ ln -s ../../../dynclasses/foo_pmc.so
$ cd -

$ ./parrot dynclasses/dynfoo.pasm
ok 1
34
ok 2
42

4) If anything changes inside parrot don't forget:

$ make -C dynclasses clean

and repeat above steps.
