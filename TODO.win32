=head1 SYNOPSIS

These are open issues of the "native" port to the Win32 platforms.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Open Issues

=over 4

=item Automatically Export Symbols

Annotate the declarations with something like

	 PARROT_API
	 Parrot_some_func

and define PARROT_API, eg for cl, as

    #ifdef PARROT_EXPORTS
    #define PARROT_API __declspec(dllexport)
    #else
    #define PARROT_API __declspec(dllimport)
    #endif

and be compiled with PARROT_EXPORTS defined.  At least cl will then
know to automatically export the symbol, without additional
module-definition file (.def).

=item Event Model

Leo says:
"Parrot on unixish systems is running two threads: the event thread
handles all kind of events (timers, notifications, signals). The IO
thread converts signals to events and is intended to run async I/O
(which would arrive as signals too). This scheme isn't carved in stone,
but it will look somehow like that.

"Win32 is internally already event based and a lot of these events like a
SIGINT (program termination signal) are messages in Win32. So I think
that Win32 needs a message loop that handles this kind of stuff. WRT
threading there are emulation layers for POSIX threads, but I doubt that
these are as efficient as Win32 functions. (Disclaimer: I really don't
know much about Win32)."

=item Threads, Events, Signals, Sockets

Anyone?
