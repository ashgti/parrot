Deprecated opcodes

newsub Pdest, IType, ILabel

C<newsub> creates a subroutine object just from a label. The
Sub object is lacking necessary meta information like name, length,
MMD-info, and more.

Use: find_name, find_global, or Sub constants instead.

Register stack opcodes

pop{i,s,p,n}, popbottom{i,s,p,n}, poptop{i,s,p,n},
push{i,s,p,n}, pushbottom{i,s,p,n}, pushtop{i,s,p,n},
savetop, restoretop,

  With the upcoming variable-sized register frame handling these opcodes
  will stop working and are useless anyway.

  use saveall/restoreall (whole register frame) or
  user stack opcodes save/restore instead.

FUTURE changes

Not yet deprecated, but it's recommended to use the new syxtax and
gradually change the old.

Subroutine attributes will use the colon syntax:

  .sub foo method, @MULTI(x,y)    => .sub foo :method :multi(x,y)
  .sub foo @ANON, @LOAD           => .sub foo :anon :load

The new syntax uses no comma separators and all sub attributes are lower
case and prefixed by a colon.

Class name IDs will require a dot in front

  $P0 = new Integer               => $P0 = new .Integer
