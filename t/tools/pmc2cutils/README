README for directory t/tools/pmc2cutils/

This directory contains test code for Parrot::Pmc2c::Pmc2cMain, a Perl5
module whose publicly callable methods and other subroutines supply
functionality for Parrot build tool 'pmc2c.pl'.

Since 'pmc2c.pl' is invoked many times during 'make', tests of its
functionality can give meaningful results only if you run them
when your file system beneath the top-level Parrot directory is in
a 'pre-make' state, i.e., you have run 'perl Configure.pl' but
have *not* yet run 'make'.  These tests should pass if run at
that point in the build process, but some will necessarily fail
if 'make' has already been executed.  Hence, they should not be
included in the set of tests run by 'make test'.

In short, these are tests of Parrot::Pmc2c::Pmc2cMain but are *not*
tests of Parrot itself.
