=head1 NAME

03-dump_vtable.t - test C<Parrot::Pmc2c::Pmc2cMain::dump_vtable()>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    % prove t/tools/pmc2cutils/03-dump_vtable.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The files in this directory test the publicly callable methods of
F<lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Pmc2cMain.pm>.  By doing so, they test the functionality
of the F<pmc2c.pl> utility.  That functionality has largely been extracted
into the methods of F<Pmc2cMain.pm>.

F<03-dump_vtable.t> tests the C<Parrot::Pmc2c::Pmc2cMain::dump_vtable()> method.
F<make> calls this method when it calls in C<tools/build/pmc2c.pl --vtable>.

When all of F<pmc2c.pl>'s functionality was contained within that program,
C<dump_vtable()> was a subroutine named C<dump_default()>.  That name was
confusing, because it suggested that what was being 'dumped' was
F<src/pmc/default.pmc> -- which was not the case.  The file which this method
takes as an argument is F<src/vtable.tbl>; hence, the method's renaming.

So as not to pollute the Parrot build directories with files created
during the testing process, all functions which create or modify
files should be called within a temporary directory.
