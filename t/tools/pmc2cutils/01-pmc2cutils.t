=head1 NAME

01-pmc2cutils.t - test Parrot::Pmc2c::Pmc2cMain basic functionality

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    % prove t/tools/pmc2cutils/01-pmc2cutils.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The files in this directory test the publicly callable methods of
F<lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Pmc2cMain.pm>.  By doing so, they test the functionality
of the F<pmc2c.pl> utility.  That functionality has largely been extracted
into the methods of F<Pmc2cMain.pm>.

F<01-pmc2cutils.t> consists solely of:

=over 4

=item 1

calls to C<Test::More::isa_ok()> and C<can_ok()> on the
constructor and publicly available methods of Parrot::Pmc2c::Pmc2cMain; and

=item 2

tests of how the constructor handles bad arguments.
