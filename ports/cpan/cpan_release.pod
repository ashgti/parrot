=head1 CPAN Release instructions

This guide provides details on the procedure for uploading a Parrot
release tarball to CPAN. This should only be done for releases in the
"supported" series.

=over 4

=item 1

To upload a Parrot release to CPAN, your PAUSE ID will need to be a
member of the PARROTRE group. Adding new members is a manual process
performed by the PAUSE maintainers, so allow some time for this to
happen.

=item 2

In PAUSE, assign yourself co-maintainer permissions on all modules owned
by PARROTRE. 

=item 3

Upload the Parrot tarball to CPAN. 

NOTE: you may get a failure message from the CPAN Indexer about the
content of META.yml. Don't panic, the tarball still uploaded okay.  You
do need to fix META.yml for the next release. Under "no_index" list any
modules that aren't properly part of the Parrot distribution. 

=item 4

Once you get a reply from the PAUSE indexer, log in to PAUSE to clean up
module permissions. Under "View Permissions" search for your PAUSE ID.
Any new modules added in this release will list your PAUSE ID as the
"owner". Change the owner to PARROTRE.
