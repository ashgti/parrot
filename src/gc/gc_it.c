=head1 NAME

src/gc/gc_it.c - Incremental Tricolor Garbage Collector

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file implements the majority of the incremental tri-color garbage
collector for Parrot. The interface for this and all collectors is
specified in F<docs/pdds/pdd09_gc.pod>.

=head2 Tricolor Mark

This collector uses a stack-based implementation of a tricolor mark
and sweep algorithm. Objects can have one of three states, called
"colors":

=over 4

=item* White

White objects are unmarked and are presumed dead. After the mark phase,
all objects which are still white are swept and recycled for later use.
Objects are marked white using the special bit flag C<GC_IT_FLAG_WHITE>.

=item* Black

Black objects are actively used, and are pointed to by one or more active
data objects. They are considered to be "alive" and are not swept or
recycled. The mark phase turns objects black when they are linked to
from another live object. Black items are marked as being black with the
special bit flag C<GC_IT_FLAG_BLACK>. During the sweep phase, black objects
are also pushed onto a stack to prevent them from being marked multiple
times and creating infinite loops out of circular data structures.

=item* Grey

Grey items are living objects whose children are not fully marked. When
the sweep phase finds a new unmarked object, it is colored grey. Once all
the children of the grey object are marked (by turning them grey), the
object is turned black. Objects are marked grey not by having a particular
bit flag in it's flag field, but by it's location: on the grey item queue.

=item* Free

Memory storage locations which are not currently in use do not have a
specific color and are marked free. Objects which are free should never be
used anywhere in Parrot, and items which are not free should never end up on
the free list.

=back

Using this tricolor scheme, we can stop the GC in mid-mark and resume later
without losing any information or losing track of any objects. All objects
start out White at the beginning of a GC run. Starting with a set of
persistant globals (such as the interpreter structure) we mark items grey by
putting them onto the queue. In the mark loop, we pop a grey item off the
queue, mark all it's children (by pushing them onto the queue), marking the
object black, and putting it for safe keeping on the "already marked" list.
We then repeat for each of the children and all the objects that were also
on the queue.

All objects are appended to a header structure in memory. The header
structure contains a pointer to another header, for use in constructing
the queue, the marked items list, and the free list. All of these "lists"
(which I will also call "queues", "stacks" or "stores" interchangably,
depending on my mood) are all linked lists constructed in this manner. The
object header also contains a field for the object's flag. We cannot reuse
the C<flags> field of PObj and isometric data types, because we manage a
few types of items which are not properly isomorphic and therefore do not
have a C<flags> field. The third and final data field in the header is
a flag to determine whether the object is an aggregate (PMC, PObj, etc) or
a simple buffer.

=head2 Basic Memory Layout

Objects and headers are concatenated in memory as shown:

    +--------------+--------------------------------------------+
    |     HDR      |                    OBJ                     |
    +--------------+--------------------------------------------+

Several HDR/OBJ structures are stored end-to-end in an arena:

    +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ ...
    |  HDR  |  OBJ  |  HDR  |  OBJ  |  HDR  |  OBJ  |  HDR    ...
    +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ ...

Unfortunately, we can't easily use array indexing to get to these objects
from the start of the arena because the OBJs are all different sizes
depending on the particular pool we are in. Pools hold objects all of a
single size, and it's very rare that any two pools contain objects of the
same size. We can use basic pointer arithmetic to get from one to the other:

    HDR2 = (HDR1 + 1) + ((char+)sizeof(OBJ))

The "(HDR1 + 1)", which can equivalently be written in array form as
"HDR[1]" moves the pointer to where a second HDR would be (if we were in
a regular array), which happens to be the start of the OBJ. From there, we
add ((char*)sizeof(OBJ)), which moves the pointer forward by the size of the
object, which should be the location of the next header. The cast to (char*)
is necessary for the pointer arithmetic. The statement "HDR + sizeof(OBJ)" in
pointer arithmetic is equivalent mathematically to
"(int)HDR + (int)(sizeof(OBJ) * sizeof(HDR))", which is very bad (and causes
segfaults like crazy, I tried).

=head2 Marking Process

marking is handled in the C<pobject_lives> function currently, which isn't
even located in this file. pobject_lives takes an object and marks it grey
by adding it to the queue. So long as there are objects on the queue, we
don't do any sweeping. Parrot calls <pobject_lives> throughtout the codebase
to mark objects as being alive. We also do a deep search at the beginning of
the mark phase, where we find the so-called "root" objects.

The root objects are found first, and added to yet another queue, the root
queue. The root queue is a tool that we can use to force incremental behavior,
when we are in an interactive mode. In basic mode, we move the entire root
queue onto the regular queue and then continue with the mark phase from there.
in incremental mode (which can be activated using a compiler macro, discussed
later). We move one item from the root queue and scan it and it's children
tree entirely. This is being called tree-at-a-time marking.

Once the root objects are found and the queue is populated with it's initial
objects, we enter the main mark loop. In the main mark loop, we pop one
object at a time off the queue, mark it's children, mark the object black,
and add it onto a list for objects which have already been marked. If we have
a circular datastructure, we can enter an infinite loop if we do not find a
way to separate objects which have already been completely marked.

Once the queue and the root queue are both empty, the mark phase is complete
and we move to the sweep phase.

=head2 Sweep Phase

The sweep phase does not use any queues. We enter each pool, one at a time,
and we enter each arena in that pool, one at a time. In the arenas, we
traverse through the list of objects and examine the flag of each. If the
object is marked black, we mark it white and move to the next. If the object
is white, we free it by marking it with the free flag, performing any
finalization required (for PMCs), and putting it onto the pool's free list.
If the object is grey, we're in big trouble because all the grey items should
have been marked black in the mark phase.

=head2 Allocations

The GC manages memory objects, and is in charge of handling allocations for
them. The GC allocates large memory chunks called arenas from the operating
system, cuts those chunks into objects, and adds those objects to a large
linked list called the free list. Each pool has it's own free list for objects
in that pool.

When Parrot needs a new object, it calls the pools allocation function, which
is a pointer to a function here in the GC. The first object is popped off
the free list and returned. If there are no objects on the free list, we have
two options: (1) Allocate a new arena with new objects, and add all of them
to the free list, or (2) perform a GC run in the hopes that we find some
objects to free up. If we gamble and perform a GC run, and it doesnt return
any objects, then we have to allocate a new arena too. This combination can
be relatively expensive, so we try not to do it too often.

=item C<void Parrot_gc_it_run>

Run the GC. Not sure what it means to "run" yet, might only run one
increment, or one step from many.

Basic Algorithm:
1) Determine which pool/generation to scan
2) Mark root items as being grey
3) For all grey items, mark all children as grey, then mark item as black
4) repeat (3) until there are no grey items in current pool/generation
5) mark all objects grey that appear in IGP lists. Repeat (1) - (4) for these
6) Add all items that are still white to the free list
7) Scan through simple buffers, add white objects to free list
8) reset all flags to white
Only reclaim objects where there are no greys in the current area,
and when a run has completed. Do not reclaim, for instance, any white
objects after a run has completed and all black objects have been turned
back to white (which would free all objects, alive or dead).

Flags and other issues:
GC_trace_normal = run a trace, or a partial trace, but not a sweep.
    set the macro CHECK_IF_WE_BREAK_BEFORE_SWEEP, however we do that,
    to break off the function after the trace phase.
GC_trace_stack_FLAG = we need to trace the C stack and the processor
    registers too. I wouldn't even know how to start doing this.
GC_lazy_FLAG = Appears we run a sweep phase if we have already marked,
    or complete the current mark and then sweep. Or, we find some other
    way to free items that are obviously dead.
GC_finish_FLAG = set all objects to dead, call all finalizers on PMC
    objects. We don't need to mark free items, since everything is going
    to die anyway.

If GC_trace_normal && (GC_IT_FLAG_NEW_MARK || GC_IT_FLAG_RESUME_MARK)
    run a trace or resume the current trace.

if GC_trace_normal && (GC_IT_FLAG_NEW_SWEEP || GC_IT_FLAG_RESUME_SWEEP)
    do nothing

if GC_lazy_FLAG && (GC_IT_FLAG_NEW_SWEEP || GC_IT_FLAG_RESUME_SWEEP)
    run a sweep, possibly to conclusion.

if GC_finish_FLAG
    run a complete sweep of the PMC area calling finalizers only but not
    marking objects or adding objects to the free list

2) We launch child threads every time this function is called. For each child
thread, we enqueue a single root (probably as a thread function parameter)

entirely, and will terminate when it's queue has become empty. When all child
threads have terminated, and when all root queue items have been scanned, we
move on to the sweep phase.
3) Same as #2, but instead of blindly launching a child thread every time this

1) Memory pool buffer that contains the actual string data

To mark a child as grey, we do one of two things:

   PMCs go through C<mark_special>
2) If the child is a non-PMC PObj, we add it's header to the queue directly,

Adds all of the new objects from a newly allocated arena structure to the
pool's free list. We start at the beginning of the arena's memory block and do
the following steps:

1) add the current object to the free list
2) calculate the address of the next GC header in the arena. This is the part
   that requires pointer dark magic, and is likely the source of bugs.
3) set the C<next> field of the current object to the address of the
   next object, which we've just calculated in #3 above. Update the current
   object pointer to point to the next item.
4) repeat for all items in the arena
