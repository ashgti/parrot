 *  r12 The Intra-Procedure call scratch register.
 *  r13 The Stack Pointer.
 *  r14 The Link Register.
 *  r15 The Program Counter.
 *
 * r0-r3 are used to pass in first 4 arguments, and are not preserved by a
 * function. Results (that would fit) are returned in r0
 * Other registers are preserved across calls, although (by implication) r14
 * and r15 are used by the call process. I don't think that it is mandated
 * that r14 on return must hold the link address.
 * r12 (ip) is only used on subroutine entry for stack frame calculations -
 * after then it is a useful scratch register. If you push r14 you get
 * another scratch register quickly.
 *
 * Most things nowadays are StrongARM or later. StrongARM is v4 of the
 * architecture. ARM6 and ARM7 cores are v3, which introduced the 32 bit
 * address bus. Earlier cores (which you won't encounter) used a 26 bit address
 * bus, with program counter and status register combined in r15

 *
 * P == 1 indicates the use of offset addressing or pre-indexed addressing (the
 *        W bit determines which). The memory address is generated by applying
 *        the offset to the base register value.
 *
 * The U bit
 *
 * Indicates whether the offset is added to the base (U == 1) or is subtracted
 * from the base (U == 0).
 *
 * The B bit
 *
 * Distinguishes between an unsigned byte (B == 1) and a word (B == 0) access.
 *
 * The W bit
 *
 * P == 0 If W == 0, the instruction is LDR, LDRB, STR or STRB and a normal
 *        memory access is performed. If W == 1, the instruction is LDRBT,
 *        LDRT, STRBT or STRT and an unprivileged (User mode) memory access is
 *        performed.
 *
 * P == 1 If W == 0, the base register is not updated (offset addressing). If
 *        W == 1, the calculated memory address is written back to the base
 *        register (pre-indexed addressing).
 *
 * The L bit
 *
 * Distinguishes between a Load (L == 1) and a Store (L == 0).
 *
 *  <Rd> is the destination register.
 *  <Rn> is the base register.
 *
 * XXX need to detail addr mode, for I = 0 and I = 1
 *
 * Note that you can take advantage of post indexed addressing to get a free
 * add onto the base register if you need it for some other purpose.
 *
 * Note that on StrongARM [and later? but not XScale :-(] if you don't use Rd
 * next instruction then a load doesn't stall if it is from the cache (ie
 * 1 cycle loads). You will want to re-order things where possible to take
 * advantage of this.
 *
 * ARM1 had register shift register as possibilities for the offset (as the
 * ALU ops still do. These took 1 more cycle, and were taken out as virtually
 * no use was found for them. However, the bit patterns they represent
 * certainly didn't used to fault as an illegal instruction on ARM2s, and
 * probably later. So beware of generating illegal bit pattern offsets, as
 * you'll get silent undefined behaviour.
