# This file provides a list of opcodes that could be listed in ops.num but
# aren't ever to be generated or implemented because they are useless and/or
# silly.
#
# The format is the same as ops.num, only without the numbers.
#
# NOTE: If you can eliminate a variant by using the "inconst" and "invar"
#       keywords, DO SO.  It's better never to allow an op to exist than
#       to create it and then suppress it.
