=head1 NAME

src/pmc_freeze.c - Freeze and thaw functionality

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Thawing PMCs uses a list with (maximum) size of the amount of PMCs to
keep track of retrieved PMCs.

The individual information of PMCs is frozen/thawed by their vtables.

To avoid recursion, the whole functionality is driven by
C<< pmc->vtable->visit >>, which is called for the first PMC initially.
Container PMCs call a "todo-callback" for all contained PMCs. The
individual action vtable (freeze/thaw) is then called for all todo-PMCs.

=item C<PMC* Parrot_thaw(PARROT_INTERP, STRING *image)>

Thaws a PMC.  Called from the C<thaw> opcode.

For now it seems cheaper to use a list for remembering contained
aggregates. We could of course decide dynamically, which strategy to
use, e.g.: given a big image, the first thawed item is a small
aggregate. This implies, it probably contains (or some big strings) more
nested containers, for which another approach could be a win.
