This directory holds the runtime libraries for the
Parrot Compiler Toolkit (PCT).  The sources for the
libraries are in compilers/pct/ and the compiled
binaries are automatically placed here by the Makefile.

The available PCT libraries are:

    PCT.pbc             - use this if you just want the general toolkit
    PCT/PAST.pbc        - the PAST compiler
    PCT/Grammar.pbc     - the PCT::Grammar base grammar
    PCT/HLLCompiler.pbc - the PCT::HLLCompiler
