README for directory t/manifest/

This directory holds files containing tests for the functionality used in
tools/dev/mk_manifest_and_skip.pl, i.e., functionality in packages such as
Parrot::Manifest, Parrot::Manifest::Files and Parrot::Manifest::Skip.

If you are revising any of this functionality, you should make those revisions
on the basis of running the tests in this directory, writing new tests as
needed.

Since the tests in this directory do not touch upon core Parrot functionality,
it is not essential that they be included in the tests run by 'make test'.

There is one other MANIFEST-related test not found in this directory:
t/distro/manifest.t.  Since this test does sanity-checking of the MANIFEST, it
should be run by 'make test' and, hence, has not been moved into this
directory.
