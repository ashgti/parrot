=item enter_nci_method

This function is being renamed to register_nci_method. The original name was
confusing (see #40801).

=head1 Deprecated methods

=item PGE

PGE::P6Regex is now a registered compiler, and should be used like so:

 <@pmichaud> it's easy; instead of  $P0 = find_global "PGE", "p6rule"
   one now does  $P0 = compreg "PGE::P6Regex"

This syntax is also true for PGE::Glob and PGE::P5Regex

=head1 Deprecated ops

From http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/ops/var.html, the following ops are 
deprecated:

=over 4

=item store_global

=item find_global

=item find_name

=back

There are several variants of some of the above ops; all are deprecated,
and are replaced by the ops {set,get}_[hll,root]_global. See also
http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/ops/var.html.

Additionally, the following (unimplemented) ops are going to be removed:

=over 4

=item adddoes

=item removedoes

=item singleton

=head1 Deprecated vtable methods

The following vtable methods are deprecated:

=over 4

=item void become_parent(PMC* class)

=item PMC* subclass(PMC* name)

=item PMC* get_anonymous_subclass()

=item PMC* new_singleton()

=back


=head1 FUTURE changes

Not yet deprecated, but it's recommended to use the new syntax and
gradually change the old.

=over 4

=item PMC Class name IDs [#41237]

... will require a dot in front

  $P0 = new Integer               => $P0 = new .Integer

=item Assignment syntax with opcodes [#36283]

When the first argument of an opcode is C<OUT>, then the assignment syntax
will be allowed, as it is today.

In any other case (i.e. C<INOUT>, C<IN>), this will become
a syntax error. For example:

    $S0 = print
    $P0 = substr 1, 2, "x"

Will have to be:

    print $S0
    substr $P0, 1, 2, "x"
