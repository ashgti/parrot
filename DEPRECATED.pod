=head1 Deprecation in Parrot

This is a list of currently deprecated features of Parrot.  Every deprecation
has an associated RT ticket.  Each item indicates the last release it's
guaranteed to appear in.  Items marked with a release of ??? are still
deprecated, but a firm deadline for their removal has not yet been established.

When deprecated items are removed, all usage of the feature in the
repository should be updated or removed; including documentation.

When deprecating opcodes, in addition to the ticket, be sure to mark the
opcode with the :deprecated flag; this will allow users to enable deprecation
warnings selectively with:

 .include 'include/warnings.pasm'
 warningson .PARROT_WARNINGS_DEPRECATED_FLAG

And then receive runtime warnings if they are using any deprecated opcodes.
The C<-w> command line option for parrot can also be used to enable all
warnings.

=item * C<pioctl> [post 0.5.1]

See RT #48589.

=item * C<store_global> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #48016. Replace usage with set_[hll,root]_global variants.

=item * C<find_global> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #48018. Replace usage with get_[hll,root]_global variants.

=item * C<new>(out PMC, in INT, in STR) [post 0.5.0]

See RT #47011.

=item * C<getclass> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #47972. Future use should use the C<get_class> opcode.

=item * C<get_mro> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #47976.

=item * Integer Type IDs [post 0.5.0]

See RT #48024. Instead of C<$P0 = new Integer> or C<$P0 = new .Integer>,
use the following syntax, which works for both PMCs and objects.

  $P0 = new 'Integer'

=item * PMC union struct [post 0.5.0]

See RT #48014. This will be removed once all core PMCs have been updated.

=item * C<<.namespace <identifier> >> syntax [post 0.5.1]

See RT #48737.

=item * Use of C<::> in identifiers [post 0.5.1]

See RT #48735.

=item * C<.namespace [ "a" .. "b" ]> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #46715.

=item * C<.namespace> (without brackets) [post 0.6.2]

All should C<.namespace> directives without brackets should take
empty brackets to indicate the root namespace.
See RT #48549.

=item * vtable name .constants and __vtable overrides [post 0.5.2]

See RT #48877.

=item * Assignment syntax with opcodes [post ???]

See RT #36283.  When the first argument of an opcode is C<OUT>, then
the assignment syntax will be allowed, as it is today.

In any other case (i.e. C<INOUT>, C<IN>), this will become
a syntax error. For example:

    $S0 = print
    $P0 = substr 1, 2, "x"

Will have to be:

    print $S0
    substr $P0, 1, 2, "x"

=item get_array, get_hash, get_scalar deprecations [post 0.6.2]

See RT#54000.  The 'get_array', 'get_hash', and 'get_scalar'
methods are now called 'list', 'hash', and 'item' respectively.
