    print "'parrotis cool': ["
    print $S0
    print "]\n"

    end
.end

=item _hello

This sub is used as the source for the stream.

It just writes some text to the stream.

=cut

.sub _hello method
    self."write"( "hello" )
    self."write"( "world!" )
    self."write"( "parrot" )
    self."write"( "is cool" )
.end
