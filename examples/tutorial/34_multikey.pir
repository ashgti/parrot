=head1 Multi-Level Keys

Hashes and arrays can be combined in a number of ways to make interesting
and complex data structures. A hash bucket may contain an array PMC, which
in turn can contain other arrays or hashes. In these cases, the keys for
each level can be combined together to form a single unique key for
a data element in the structure.

This technique works equally well for arrays-of-arrays, hashes-of-hashes,
and combination structures as well.
