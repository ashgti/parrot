=head1 Math Operations (continued)

Some math operations have an opcode name, but no simple operator syntax in
PIR. In these cases you can use the opcode name directly.

For a large list of the various mathematical operations supported by Parrot,
see the documentation at F<src/ops/math.ops>.

    $I1 = fact 5    # the factorial of 5 is 120
    inc $I1         # 120 incremented by 1 is 121
    print $I1
