The oo?.p? oo benchmarks are as follows ('+' = has, '-' = has not,
'?' = kind of has):

		pasm	pl	py	rb
oo1	new1e5	+	+	+	+
oo2	new5e5	+	+	+	+
oo3	get	+	+	?	?
oo4	set	+	+	?	?
oo5	get	+	+	+	+
oo6	set	+	+	+	+

The oo1-oo2 test creation of objects, the oo1 creating 1e5 objects
and the oo2 creating 5e5 objects.
The oo3 and oo5 test getters, 2 times 5e5 gets to a single object.
The oo4 and oo6 test setters, 2 times 5e5 sets to a single object.

In the oo5 and oo6 the getters and setters go through "real" (named) method.
