Revision history for a Befunge interpreter written for Parrot.

0.3.0 Fri Jan  9 13:41:38 CET 2009
        Ported to latest parrot PIR (from 2002 pasm, ouch)

0.2.2 Tue May 30 20:59:09 CEST 2005
        Use standard PMCs instead of Perl* PMCs

0.2.1 Sat May 9 2005 21:38:40 CEST 2005
        Add t/harness and t/basic.t in order to be able to include
        befunge in unified languages testing

0.2.0 Sat Oct 23 19:43:11 CEST 2004
        Befunge-93 is now fully implemented!
        Thanks to Stepan Roh:
          - fixed input instruction (now that parrot does better i/o)
          - fixed output buffering
          - fixed . instruction which is supposed to output a space
            after the number

0.1.2 Thu Jan  2 17:50:25 CET 2003
        - new debugger instruction: "delete", that allows to clear
          breakpoints (those created by the "break" instruction)

0.1.1 Mon Dec 30 18:12:34 CET 2002
        - debugger now accepts breakpoints: either on instructions
          (characters), or on a specified location (x,y), or on a
          given row, or on a given column

0.1.0 Sat Dec 21 14:58:24 CET 2002
        - playfield now is an array of array (of integers) instead of
          an array of strings.
        - load, io and debug updated to reflect this.
        - new versioning scheme, and minor version incrementing since
          this is a big step for the project.

0.06  Sun Dec  1 10:00:35 CET 2002
        - debugger can now interact with user.
        - debugger can dump playfield.
        - debugger can print information about current IP.
        - debugger can execute a befunge program step by step.

0.05  Sat Nov 30 11:31:25 CET 2002
        - new file debug.pasm that will handle all the debugging
          capabilities of the interpreter.
        - the verbose flag (-v) is replaced with a debug flag (-d) to
          activate the integrated debugger.

0.04  Sat Nov 23 10:22:51 CET 2002
        - now using the push and pop instructions of the PerlArray
          PMC, and thanks go to Steve Fink for his hack to pop an
          empty PerlArray.

0.03  Mon Sep  9 21:26:11 CEST 2002
        - taking advantage of Parrot's 'chr' instruction, getting rid
          of Clinton Pierce's hack.

0.02  Mon Aug 19 21:24:05 CEST 2002
        - fixing bug when loading a file not properly newline-terminated.

0.01  Fri Aug 16 20:59:10 CEST 2002
	- original version.
        - every instruction is implemented, and tested.
        - input instructions ( '&' and '~') are kinda buggy.
        - a "verbose" flag (-v) can help you debug your Befunge code
          (as if it were hard to debug Befunge - pfff! :o) )
