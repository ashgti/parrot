This directory contains PIR programs for the Computer Language Shootout at
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/

The first line:

  #!./parrot -j

is indicating the preferred because fastest runcore for that benchmark.

If you want your PIR program (toto.pir) to be automatically tested (by t/examples/shootout.t) : 
just  put the expected output file along, call it toto.pir.output
If you need an input file, to be read from stdin, call it toto.pir.input
