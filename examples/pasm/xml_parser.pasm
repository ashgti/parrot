=head1 NAME

examples/pasm/xml_parser.pasm - Simple XML Parser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    % ./parrot examples/pasm/xml_parser.pasm examples/pasm/small.xml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a rudimentary XML-ish parser in PASM. It currently handles only
well-formed XML, doesn't throw errors, etc...

Limitations:

=over 4

=item * validation? check for well formedness? Dream on.

=item * elements like C<&lt;> aren't handled yet

=item * bugs-a-plenty, I'm sure.

=back

This is more of a proof-of-concept than anything else. Try putting this
in a file:

    <xml version='1.0'>
    <top>
    <inner foo='bar' narf='poit'>
    <junk>Hello</junk>
    <empty/>
    </inner>
    </top>

And see what it does.  :)

See the notes near the C<read()> for IO problem notes.

Register Usage:

    S0, S1, S2, S5 -- Temporary Registers
    S7             -- Current token in procintags()
    S10            -- HACK for broken I/O
    S11            -- Character being processed
    I0, I1, I2     -- Temporary Registers
    I7             -- Type of current element
    I8             -- "In Quotes" flag
    I13            -- Type of the last token

The stack is used all to hell.  :)

Data is stored on the stack in type/value pairs:

      -1 ""  (uninitialized slot)
       0 Element Name
       1 Attribute Name
       2 Attribute Value
       5 Close of Element (no data)
       6 Close of Element, also start (no data)
      99 Data associated with this element
    1000 (no data) sentinel for the bottom of the stack

# **** BUG BUG BUG *****  TEMPORARY ROUTINE
# For now Parrot's I/O seems completely b0rk3n
#    instead, just pull characters off "S10" which
#    contains the XML to be processed.  Trying to perform
#    a read loop with everything else going on smashes the
#    user stack.  Sometimes.
