=head1 NAME

examples/languages/abc/t/01-tests.t - test harness for Parrot abc

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is the current implementation for the abc test harness. The
tests are actually in simple text files, this harness given this list of
tests sources, executes all the tests.

The test source is a plain text file divided in three columns. The
columns are separated by three white spaces C<\s{3,}> or at least one
tab C<\t+>. The three columns are:

=over 4

=item B<expression>

The exact expression that is passed to the abc compiler as source code.
This input is pasted as a double quotes delimited string into PIR code.
This means that you can use \n to indicate newlines.

=item B<expected>

The expected result for the compiled source. Note that you can (and
probably should) use C<\n> in the expected result to represent newlines.

=item B<description>

This should be a string describing the test that is being made.

=back

Since this is supposed to be a temporary harness. We're expecting to be
able to capture the result of the compilation to write this file in PIR.
The skip and todo tests are defined in the test source file itself, so
that later when the harness is changed we don't have to bother to convert
the skip/todo tests list. So, you can simply set a test to be todo or
skipped by adding the C<SKIP> or C<TODO> keywords in the begin of the
test description. For example:

1+2+3           6       SKIP no add operation yet
1-2-3           6       TODO no minus operation yet

B<NOTE:> to add more source test files remember to update the C<@files>
array in this file.
