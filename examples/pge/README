This is a short README until I have time to write a longer
one.

Files in this directory:

   all.pir - program that demonstrates a variety of parses using PGE.
     Includes:  
       simple.pir - parser for simple mathematical expressions (<Simple::expr>)


Start by running "all.pir".  To parse simple mathematical expressions
(e.g., "r = sqrt(a*b + 5)"), enter

    rule <Simple::expr>

and then enter mathematical expressions after that.

Note that this is all a work in progress, so some features might
not be working yet.
