This is a short README until I have time to write a longer
one.

Files in this directory:

   all.pir - program that demonstrates a variety of parses using PGE.
     Includes:  
       simple.pir - parser for simple mathematical expressions (<Simple::expr>)
       p6parse.pir - Perl 6 expression parser (<Perl6::expr>)


Start by running "all.pir".  To parse simple mathematical expressions
(e.g., "r = sqrt(a*b + 5)"), enter

    rule <Simple::expr>

and then enter mathematical expressions after that.

To parse Perl 6 expressions, enter

    rule <Perl6::expr>

and then type in p6 expressions to see the resulting parse.  

Note that this is all a work in progress, so some features might
not be working yet.
