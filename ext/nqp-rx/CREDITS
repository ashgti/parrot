    Following in the steps of other open source projects that
    eventually take over the world, here is the partial list
    of people who have contributed to Rakudo and its supporting
    works.  It is sorted by name and formatted to allow easy
    grepping and beautification by scripts.
    The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W),
    description (D), subversion username (U) and snail-mail
    address (S).

        Thanks,

        The NQP Team
        PS: Yes, this looks remarkably like the Linux CREDITS format
        PPS: This file is encoded in UTF-8
