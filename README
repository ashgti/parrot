INSTRUCTIONS
------------

For now, unpack your Parrot tarball, (if you're reading this, you've
probably already done that) type

    make test_prog

and the test interpreter should build.

test_prog is a Parrot interpreter which can read in bytecode from a
file. To assemble Parrot assembly into bytecode, type

    perl assemble.pl test.pasm > test.pbc

You can then execute the compiled bytecode with

    ./test_prog test.pbc

There is some documentation in docs/, but this is a very early alpha
release, so for the most part, you're on your own.

Have fun,
The Parrot team.
