INSTRUCTIONS
------------

For now, unpack your Parrot tarball, (if you're reading this, you've
probably already done that) type

    perl Configure.pl

to run the Configure script.  This will generate a config.h header, a
Parrot::Config module, and a Makefile.  Next type

    make test_prog

and the test interpreter should build.

You can test the assembler and interpreter by running

    make test

There is some documentation in docs/, but this is a very early alpha
release, so for the most part, you're on your own.

Have fun,
The Parrot team.
