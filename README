PREREQUISITES
-------------

You'll need a compiler and linker, of course.  A make program
is currently encouraged, but we have had difficulties with some
versions (like nmake), so we do have a primitive script
that attempts to emulate it.

You'll also need Perl 5.005 or above, compiled to support
the types you wish to support in Parrot.  (Parrot will
make, but you'll be unable to assemble anything.)  You can find
what types are support by typing 'perl -V', and examining the
values for ivtype and nvtype.  Parrot should work with INTVALs
and NUMVALs up to those types.

For most of the platforms that we are supporting initially,
Parrot should build out of the box.  We do not have,
however, native dynamic loading ready for OS X, and are
currently using Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net) to fill
that gap.  Other solutions may also work.  The list of
targetted platforms can be found in docs/parrot.pod.

The current configure system is primitive, as it's only
a temporary solution.  It will be happy with most any answers
you decide to feed it.  Garbage In, Garbage Out.

You may want to peruse the list of KNOWN_ISSUES to see
what other things may be unexpected.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

For now, unpack your Parrot tarball, (if you're reading this, you've
probably already done that) and type

    perl Configure.pl

to run the Configure script.  This will generate a config.h header, a
Parrot::Config module, and a Makefile.  Next type

    make 

and the interpreter should build.

You can test the assembler and interpreter by running

    make test

Look at docs/parrot.pod and docs/intro.pod for where to go from here.
