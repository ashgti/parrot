=head1 NAME

SDL::Sprite - Parrot class representing sprites in Parrot SDL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # load this library
    load_bytecode 'SDL/Sprite.pir'

    # ... load a new SDL::Image into image

    # create a new SDL::Sprite object
    .local pmc sprite
    sprite = new 'SDL::Sprite'

    # set the sprite's arguments
    sprite.'init'( 'surface'  => image, 'source_x' =>     0, 'source_y' =>     0, 'dest_x'   =>   270, 'dest_y'   =>   212, 'bgcolor'  => black )


    # if the image has multiple tiles that represent animation frames, set the
    # width and height of each tile
    # 'width'    =>   100, 'height'   =>    56

    # ... draw the sprite to surfaces as you will

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A SDL::Sprite object represents an image and its position.  By changing the
coordinates of the sprite, you'll change its position when it draws itself to a
surface.

This is a class in progress; it has to represent several different drawing
styles.

=head1 METHODS

A SDL::Sprite object has the following methods:

=over 4

=cut

.namespace [ 'SDL::Sprite' ]

.sub _initialize :load

    .local   pmc sprite_class
    newclass     sprite_class, 'SDL::Sprite'

    addattribute sprite_class, 'surface'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'source_rect'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'prev_rect'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'rect'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'bgcolor'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'drawn_rect'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'undrawn_rect'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'x_velocity'
    addattribute sprite_class, 'y_velocity'

.end

=item init( 'arg' => pairs )

Given argument key-value pairs, sets the attributes of this object.  The useful
keys are as follows:

=over 4

=item surface

The SDL::Image from which to draw the sprite frames.

=item source_x

The x coordinate within the C<surface> from which to start drawing.

=item source_y

The y coordinate within the C<surface> from which to start drawing.

=item dest_x

The x coordinate within the destination surface to which to draw.

=item dest_y

The y coordinate within the destination surface to which to draw.

=item bgcolor

A SDL::Color object representing the background color of the main surface.
This will come in handy when drawing over the previous position of this sprite,
unless you redraw the entire surface on every frame.

=item width

The width of the image, in pixels, to draw.  If you have multiple frames of an
animation within the image provided, set the width here to the width of a
single frame.

If you don't set this value, this will use the current width of the image.

=item height

The height of the image, in pixels, to draw.  If you have multiple frames of an
animation within the image provided, set the height here to the height of a
single frame.

If you don't set this value, this will use the current height of the image.

=back

B<Note:>  I'm not completely thrilled with these arguments, so they may change
slightly.

.end

=item draw_undraw( surface )

Draws the image this object represents to the given SDL::Surface.  This will
return two SDL::Rect objects, one representing the previous position of this
sprite and one representing the current position.

Use this when dealing with a single-buffered main window.  You'll need to call
C<update_rect()> on the C<surface> to make things actually show up, if it's the
main surface.

Note that this will fill in the previous position with the background color set
in the constructor.

=cut

.sub draw_undraw :method
    .param pmc dest_surface

    .local pmc surface
    .local pmc source_rect
    .local pmc rect
    .local pmc prev_rect
    .local pmc bgcolor

    .local pmc drawn_rect
    .local pmc undrawn_rect

    surface      = self.'surface'()
    source_rect  = self.'source_rect'()
    rect         = self.'rect'()
    prev_rect    = self.'prev_rect'()
    bgcolor      = self.'bgcolor'()

    undrawn_rect = self.'undrawn_rect'()

    dest_surface.'fill_rect'( prev_rect, bgcolor )
    dest_surface.'blit'( surface, source_rect, rect )

    .local int x
    .local int y

    x = prev_rect.'x'()
    y = prev_rect.'y'()

    undrawn_rect.'x'( x )
    undrawn_rect.'y'( y )

    x = rect.'x'()
    y = rect.'y'()

    drawn_rect.'x'( x )
    drawn_rect.'y'( y )
    prev_rect.'x'( x )
    prev_rect.'y'( y )

    .return( drawn_rect, undrawn_rect )
.end

=item draw( surface )

Draws the image represented by this object to the given surface.  This will
also fill the previous position of the image with the background color.
(Arguably, this is not always right, but I know about it and will figure
something out, unless you have a better idea and let me know first.)

Use this when dealing with a double-buffered main window.  In that case, you
will have to call C<flip()> on the C<surface> yourself to make your changes
appear.

=cut

    .param pmc dest_surface

    dest_surface.'blit'( surface, source_rect, rect )

    .local int x

    x = rect.'x'()
    y = rect.'y'()
    prev_rect.'x'( x )
    prev_rect.'y'( y )

=item surface()

Returns the underlying surface of the image represented by this class.  You
should never need to call this directly, unless you're working with the raw SDL
functions.

=cut

.sub surface :method
    .local pmc surface
    getattribute surface, self, 'surface'

    .return( surface )
.end

=item source_rect()

Returns the SDL::Rect object representing the source from which to draw within
the underlying image.

You should never need to call this directly.

=cut

.sub source_rect :method
    .local pmc source_rect
    getattribute source_rect, self, 'source_rect'

    .return( source_rect )
.end

=item prev_rect()

Returns the SDL::Rect representing the previous position of this sprite within
a destination surface.

You should never need to call this directly.

    .local pmc prev_rect
    getattribute prev_rect, self, 'prev_rect'

    .return( prev_rect )
.end

=item rect()

Returns the SDL::Rect representing this sprite's current position within the
destination surface.

You should never need to call this directly.

=cut

.sub rect :method
    .local pmc rect
    getattribute rect, self, 'rect'

    .return( rect )
.end

=item bgcolor()

Returns the SDL::Color object representing the background color to draw to the
destination when undrawing the previous position of this sprite.

You should never need to call this directly.

=cut

.sub bgcolor :method
    .local pmc bgcolor
    getattribute bgcolor, self, 'bgcolor'

    .return( bgcolor )
.end

=item drawn_rect()

Returns the SDL::Rect representing the current position of the sprite within
the destination surface as of the current drawing operation.

You should I<never> need to call this directly.  I mean it.  This may go away
suddenly in a brilliant flash of insight.

=cut

.sub drawn_rect :method
    .local pmc drawn_rect
    getattribute drawn_rect, self, 'drawn_rect'

    .return( drawn_rect )

    .local int result
    result = rect.'y'()

    .return( result )

=item x_velocity( [ new_x_velocity ] )
