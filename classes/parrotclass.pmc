/* The structure of a parrot class is reasonably straightforward. The
   PMC's cached integer value is the number of attribute slots that
   an object of this type requires. The data pointer holds a pointer
   to an array of PMCs. That array has:

   0: An array of immediate parents
   1: An array of all parents, in search order
   2: A hash, keys are the class names, values are the offsets to
      their attributes
   3: A hash, the keys are the classname/attrib name pair (separated
      by a NULL), while the value is the offset to the attribute
   4: The class name PMC
