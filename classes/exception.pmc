 *  Overview:
 *     This is the exception base class
 *  Data Structure and Algorithms:
 *     As we are still lacking objects, this class is based
 *     on a PerlHash. This will probably change.
 *     An exception object has these attributes:
 *     - _message ... textual representation
 *     - _type    ... exception type (s. exceptions.h, except_type.pasm)
 *     - _severity .. exception severity (s. -""-, except_severity.pasm)
 *     - _P5      ... contents of REG_PMC(5)
 *     Optional:
 *     - _C_file ...  origin of exception
 *     - _C_line ...    in C code
 *     - _P_file ...  origin of exception
 *     - _P_line ....   in PASM/PIR/Perl ... source
 *     - _return_cc . return continuation
 *     - any information attached by the HL. This shouldn't start
 *       with an underscore (that is reserved for Parrot's internal
 *       usage.
 *  History:
 *     Initial revision by leo 2003.07.10
 *  Notes:
 *     When an exception handler is called, the exception object is
 *     passed as REG_PMC(5), the original contents of this register
 *     is in the exception object's _P5 attribute.
