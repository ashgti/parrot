Notes for Mac OS X builders
---------------------------

At the moment, Parrot requires fink (fink.sourceforge.net) to be
installed. This is purely a stopgap measure, as fink provides some
headers and functions that made a first port simpler. Once Parrot's
adapted to the native interface (it's all the dynamic loading of
libraries code) the need for Fink will be removed.
