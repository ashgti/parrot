=head1 Syntax Highlighting

Included in this directory are some add-ins for making working on parrot (or in
parrot) easier, for various popular editors. Mostly that means
syntax-highlighting and automatic indenting. Read on to see what's available for
your favorite editor

=head2 Vim

There are four files here: C<imc.vim> (generated from C<imc.vim.in>),
C<pasm.vim>, C<pmc.vim>, and C<filetype_parrot.vim>. The first three are syntax
files, and the last is a filetype script that tells vim to associate the
extensions .imc, .imcc, .pasm, and .pmc with the right syntax. Copy C<imc.vim>,
C<pasm.vim>, and C<pmc.vim> into C<~/.vim/syntax> or C<$VIMRUNTIME/syntax>,
creating the directory if it doesn't exist. Copy C<filetype_parrot.vim> into
C<~/.vim/ftdetect> or C<$VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect>, creating the directory if it
doesn't exist. C<pmc.vim> requires C<pod.vim>, which is standard in the Vim
distribution.

=head2 Kate

There is a syntax file for the KDE editor Kate, but it is not built by default.
 make imc.kate
in C<editor/> to build it.

TODO: How do we install Kate syntax files?

=head2 Emacs

Included here is an Emacs mode for editing pasm files, in C<pasm.el>.

TODO: How do we install Emacs modes?

=head2 TAGS file

There is a script here to automatically generate a TAGS file, which works with
Vim and other editors that recognize ctags-format files. The tool "exuberant
ctags" is required. Run
 make tags
in the parrot root directory to build the tags file.
