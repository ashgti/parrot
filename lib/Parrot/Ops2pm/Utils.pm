=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils provides methods called by F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>, a
program which is called at the very beginning of the Parrot F<make> process.
The program's function is to build two files:

=over 4

=item * F<lib/Parrot/OpLib/core.pm>

=item * F<include/parrot/oplib/ops.h>

=back

The functionality originally found in F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> has been
extracted into this package's methods in order to support component-focused
testing and future refactoring.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Process files provided as command-line arguments to
F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> and construct a Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils object.

=item * Arguments

Hash reference with the following elements:

    argv        :   reference to @ARGV
    nolines     :   set to true value to eliminate #line
                    directives in output
    renum       :   set to true value if
    moddir      :   directory where output module is created
                    (generally, lib/Parrot/OpLib)
    module      :   name of output module
                    (generally, core.pm)
    inc_dir     :   directory where C-header file is created
                    (generally, include/parrot/oplib)
    inc_f       :   name of output C-header file
                    (generally, ops.h)
    script      :   name of the script to be executed by 'make'
                    (generally, tools/build/ops2pm.pl)

=item * Return Value

Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils object.

=item * Comment

Arguments for the constructor have been selected so as to provide
subsequent methods with all information needed to execute properly and to be
testable.  A Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils object I<can> be constructed lacking some
of these arguments and still suffice for the execution of particular methods
-- this is done during the test suite -- but such an object would not suffice
for F<make>'s call to F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>.

    my ( $class, $argsref ) = @_;

=head2 C<prepare_ops()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Call C<Parrot::OpsFile::new()>, then populate the resulting
C<$opts> hash reference with information from  each of the F<.ops> files
provided as command-line arguments to F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>.

=item * Arguments

None.  (Implicitly requires that at least the C<argv> and
C<script> elements were provided to the constructor.)

=item * Return Value

None.  Internally, sets the C<ops> key in the object's data
structure.

=item * Comment

This method calls C<Parrot::OpsFile::new()> on the first F<.ops>
file found in C<@ARGV>, then copies the ops from the remaining F<.ops> files
to the object just created.  Experimental ops are marked as such.

=back

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    my $ops = Parrot::OpsFile->new( [ $self->{file} ], $self->{nolines} );

        unless defined $ops;

    # Copy the ops from the remaining .ops files to the object just created.
    my %seen;

    while ( defined( my $f = shift( @{ $self->{argv} } ) ) ) {
        if ( $seen{$f} ) {
            print STDERR "$self->{script}: Ops file '$f' mentioned more than once!\n";
            next;
        }
        $seen{$f} = 1;

        die "$self->{script}: Could not find ops file '$f'!\n"
            unless -e $f;
        my $temp_ops = Parrot::OpsFile->new( [$f], $self->{nolines} );
        die "$self->{script}: Could not read ops file '$f'!\n"
            unless defined $temp_ops;
        die "OPS invalid for $f" unless ref $temp_ops->{OPS};

        my $experimental = $f =~ /experimental/;

        # mark experimental ops
        if ($experimental) {
            for my $el ( @{ $temp_ops->{OPS} } ) {
                $el->{experimental} = 1;
            }
        }

        push @{ $ops->{OPS} }, @{ $temp_ops->{OPS} };
        $ops->{PREAMBLE} .= "\n" . $temp_ops->{PREAMBLE};
    }
    $self->{ops} = $ops;
}

=head2 C<renum_op_map_file()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Triggered when F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> is called with the
C<--renum> flag, this method renumbers F<src/ops/ops.num> based on the already
existing file of that name and additional F<.ops> files.

=item * Arguments

String holding name of an F<.ops> file; defaults to
F<src/ops/ops.num>.  (Implicitly requires that the C<argv>,
C<script> and C<renum> elements were provided to the constructor.)

=item * Return Value

Returns true value upon success.

=item * Comment

When F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> is called with the C<--renum> option, this
method is triggered, after which F<ops2pm.pl> exits.  Consequently, this is
the only Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils method which is I<not> a
stepping stone on the path to building F<lib/Parrot/OpLib/core.pm>.

=head2 C<load_op_map_files()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

When F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> is called by F<make>, this method
checks the number of ops strictly against F<src/ops/ops.num> and renumbers as
needed.

=item * Arguments

None.  (Implicitly requires that the C<argv> and C<script> keys
have been provided to the constructor and that the C<renum> key not have a
true value -- which will be the case when the C<--renum> option is I<not>
provided to F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>.)

=item * Return Value

Returns true value upon success.  Internally, sets these
values in these elements in the object's data structure:  C<max_op_num>,
C<skiptable> and C<optable>.

=item * Comments

This is the default case, I<i.e.,> the case that prevails when
F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> is I<not> called with the C<--renum> flag.  In
addition to F<src/ops/ops.num>, this method also draws upon information in
F<src/ops/ops.skip>.

=item * Purpose

Internal manipulation of the Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils object:
sorting by number of the list of op codes found in the object's

=head1 NOTE ON TESTING

A suite of test files to accompany this package is found in
F<t/tools/ops2pmutils>.  This suite has been developed to maximize its
coverage of the code of Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils (as measured by Perl module
Devel::Cover).  Should you wish to refactor this package, it is recommended
that you do so in a B<test-driven> manner:

=over 4

=item 1

Write the specification for any additions or modifications to
Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils' interface.

=item 2

Write tests that reflect any such modifications.

=item 3

Write the additional or modified code that reflects the new specification.

=item 4

Test the new code and debug.  The tests in the suite should be run B<after>
Parrot's F<Configure.pl> has run but B<before> F<make> has run.  Example:

    $> perl Configure.pl
    $> prove -v t/tools/ops2pmutils/*.t
    $> make

=item 5

Use Devel::Cover to measure the extent to which the existing and new tests
cover the existing and revised code.

=item 6

Refactor and retest to ensure high test coverage.

=back

This package's methods are called by F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>, which in turn
is invoked by F<make> in the Parrot build process.  Successful execution of
F<make> proves that the functionality in this package achieved its overall
objective but does not necessarily invoke many of the individual code
statements in the package.  That is the rationale for the component-focused
testing provided by the test suite.

=head1 AUTHOR

See F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> for a list of the Parrot hackers who, over a
period of several years, developed the functionality now found in the methods
of Parrot::Ops2pm::Utils.  Jim Keenan extracted that functionality and placed
it in this package's methods.
