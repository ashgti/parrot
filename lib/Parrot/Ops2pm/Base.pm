Parrot::Ops2pm::Base - Methods inherited by Parrot::Ops2pm and Parrot::OpsRenumber.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use base qw( Parrot::Ops2pm::Base );

    $self = Parrot::Ops2pm->new( {
        argv            => [ @ARGV ],
        nolines         => $nolines_flag,
        moddir          => "lib/Parrot/OpLib",
        module          => "core.pm",
        inc_dir         => "include/parrot/oplib",
        inc_f           => "ops.h",

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parrot::Ops2pm::Base provides a constructor and other method(s) to be
inherited by Parrot::Ops2pm and Parrot::OpsRenumber.  The former provides
methods called by F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>, a program which is called at the
very beginning of the Parrot F<make> process.  The latter is called by
F<tools/dev/opsrenumber.pl>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Process files provided as command-line arguments to
F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl> and construct a Parrot::Ops2pm object.

=item * Arguments

Hash reference with the following elements:

    argv        :   reference to @ARGV
    nolines     :   set to true value to eliminate #line
                    directives in output
    moddir      :   directory where output module is created
                    (generally, lib/Parrot/OpLib)
    module      :   name of output module
                    (generally, core.pm)
    inc_dir     :   directory where C-header file is created
                    (generally, include/parrot/oplib)
    inc_f       :   name of output C-header file
                    (generally, ops.h)
    script      :   name of the script to be executed by 'make'
                    (generally, either tools/build/ops2pm.pl
                    or tools/dev/opsrenumber.pl)

=item * Return Value

Object of the invoking class (Parrot::Ops2pm or Parrot::OpsRenumber, as the
case may be).

=item * Comment

Arguments for the constructor have been selected so as to provide
subsequent methods with all information needed to execute properly and to be
testable.  A Parrot::Ops2pm object I<can> be constructed lacking some
of these arguments and still suffice for the execution of particular methods
-- this is done during the test suite -- but such an object would not suffice
for F<make>'s call to F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>.

=head2 C<prepare_ops()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Call C<Parrot::OpsFile::new()>, then populate the resulting
C<$opts> hash reference with information from  each of the F<.ops> files
provided as command-line arguments to F<tools/build/ops2pm.pl>.

=item * Arguments

None.  (Implicitly requires that at least the C<argv> and
C<script> elements were provided to the constructor.)

=item * Return Value

None.  Internally, sets the C<ops> key in the object's data
structure.

=item * Comment

This method calls C<Parrot::OpsFile::new()> on the first F<.ops>
file found in C<@ARGV>, then copies the ops from the remaining F<.ops> files
to the object just created.  Experimental ops are marked as such.
