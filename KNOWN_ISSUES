Here's the list of things that we know are broken, or
are admittedly hackish stopgap measures.

- 'long doubles' don't work.  It's a packfile thing, which
will eventually change.  They'll be fixed then.
- Continuations don't yet play well with the garbage collector
  Turn GC off if you want to have fun.
