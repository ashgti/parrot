=head1 NAME

README.cygwin - Parrot under cygwin

=head1 SYNOPSIS 

parrot builds out of the box under cygwin. 
Some tweaks are needed for different names of dynamic loading of some dll's.

=head1 ICU 

This is no official cygwin package yet.
However, icu4c-3_8 builds out of the box on cygwin.
  http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4c/3.8/icu4c-3_8-src.tgz

Note that ICU is now optional, you can build Parrot without it, 
by not installing it or asking Parrot to ignore it (C<--without-icu>). 

=head1 INSTALL

  perl Configure.pl 
  make
  make test
  make reallyinstall

=head1 TODO

=over

=item Makefile tuning

rename libparrot.dll to cygparrot.dll, create an interim libparrot.dll.a

for make test:
blib/lib must be added to the PATH, or link blib/lib/libparrot.dll to the parrot root.
  ln blib/lib/libparrot.dll libparrot.dll

=item DLL versioning

cyg*-1.1.dll instead of lib*.so.1.1

Thanks to the L<Windows DLL Hell / http://> and the impossibility of file 
hardlinks, windows dll names are versioned, so the loadlib function or the various 
pir's needs more logic.

Either add the version to each loadlib call, and stem the version from 
POSIX versions within get_path(), or add an optional version argument to 
loadlib for win32. Or just fix all the pir's.

=item Configure

nmake detection probably wrong. replace by make.

=item Features

Threads, Events, and Signals are missing.
