=head1 Format of the Parrot bytecode

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  | Wordsize |  Major   |  Minor   |  Flags   |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

Wordsize must be at least 4 (32-bit). Loader is
responsible for transforming the file into the
VM native wordsize on the fly. For performance,
a utility should be provided to convert PBCs
on disk if they cannot be recompiled.

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

Byteorder that this file is in. Transform the
file's byteorder matrix (b) with our native (n),
which results in the transform
  b by n -> t
Consider a PDP-11 (2301) reading a Sparc generated (3210).
The transform matrix (t) is (1032) which passed to
endian_fetch_* for arbitrary transform by the VM.

  |         Parrot Magic = 0x 13155a1         |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

Magic is stored in native byteorder. The loader
uses the byteorder header to convert the Magic
to verify. More specifically, ALL words (non-bytes)
in the bytecode file are stored in native order,
unless otherwise specified.

  |         Opcode Type (Perl = 0x5045524c)   |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

 
  For each segment:

  4, 4 + (4 + S0), 4 + (4 + S0) + (4 + S1)
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |       Segment length in bytes (S)         |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                                           |
  :        S bytes of segment content         :
  |                                           |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

Currently there are three segment types defined, and they must occur
in precisely the order: FIXUP, CONSTANT TABLE, BYTE CODE. Every
segment must be present, even if empty.


=head2 FIXUP SEGMENT

  << The format for the FIXUP segment is not yet defined. >>


=head2 CONSTANT TABLE SEGMENT

  0 (relative)
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |            Constant Count (N)             |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

For each constant:

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |             Constant Type (T)             |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |             Constant Size (S)             |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                                           |
  |        S bytes of constant content        |
  :       appropriate for representing        :
  |              a value of type T            |
  |                                           |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+


=head2 CONSTANTS

For integer constants:

  << integer constants are represented as manifest constants in
     the byte code stream currently, limiting them to 32 bit values. >>

For number constants (S is constant, and is equal to C<sizeof(FLOATVAL)>):

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                                           |
  |             S' bytes of Data              |
  |                                           |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

where

  S' = S + (S % 4) ? (4 - (S % 4)) : 0

If S' E<gt> S, then the extra bytes are filled with zeros.
 

For string constants (S varies, and is the size of the particular string):

  4, 4 + (16 + S'0), 4 + (16 + S'0) + (16 + S'1)
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                   Flags                   |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                  Encoding                 |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                   Type                    |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                  Size (S)                 |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |                                           |
  :             S' bytes of Data              :
  |                                           |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

where

  S' = S + (S % 4) ? (4 - (S % 4)) : 0

If S' E<gt> S, then the extra bytes are filled with zeros.
 

=head2 BYTE CODE SEGMENT

The pieces that can be found in the byte code segment are as
follows:

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |              Operation Code               |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |             Register Argument             |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |    Integer Argument (Manifest Constant)   |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |   String Argument (Constant Table Index)  |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

  +----------+----------+----------+----------+
  |   Number Argument (Constant Table Index)  |
  +----------+----------+----------+----------+

The number and types for each argument can be determined by
consulting Parrot::Opcode.


=head2 SOURCE CODE SEGMENT

Currently there are no utilities that use this segment, even
though it is mentioned in some of the early Parrot documents.

Eventually there will be a more complete and useful PackFile
specification, but this simple format works well enough for
now (c. Parrot 0.0.5).
