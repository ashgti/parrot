docs/compiler_faq.pod - Parrot FAQ for compiler writers

=head1 General Questions

=head2 Which C compilers can I use with Parrot?

Whoa, there--you're looking at the wrong FAQ.  This document is for people
writing compilers that target Parrot.

To answer your question, though, Parrot should theoretically work with any
C89-compliant C compiler, although some features require C<gcc>.  See the
F<README> files in the root directory for more information about building
Parrot.
