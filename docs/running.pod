=head1 Running Parrot code

This file briefly describes the current set of executables and what
they're for. But mostly, it mentions all the restrictions and
incomplete bits of these commands, in the hopes that people will fix
them and modify this document accordingly.

=item C<assemble.pl>

Converts a Parrot Assembly file to Parrot ByteCode.

  assemble.pl foo.pasm > foo.pbc

Usage information: no usage message available. There is some amount of
malformed POD visible by running C<perldoc -F Parrot/Assembler.pm>.

=item C<test_parrot>

Interprets a Parrot ByteCode file.

  test_parrot <filename>.pbc

C<test_parrot> has two alternate modes of operation: prederef mode
(C<test_parrot -P>) and jit mode (C<test_parrot -j>).

Jit mode works for the mops.pasm test, but doesn't work for many other
things. The reason why is unknown.

Prederef mode only works as a shared library. For example, on most
Unix platforms:

  make clean
  make shared
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=blib/lib ./test_parrot -P <filename>.pbc

You will not be able to use any of the automatic testing targets after
running C<make shared>.

C<test_parrot> also has several debugging and tracing flags; see the
usage description (currently, a comment in test_main.c) for details.

=item C<optimizer.pl>

Does something. Use it by running

  something

Usage information: none available.

=item C<pdump>

Does something. Use it by running

  something

Usage information: none available.

=item C<pbc2c.pl>

Converts a bytecode file to a native .c file.

  perl pbc2c.pl foo.pbc > foo.c

Usage information: C<perldoc -F pbc2c.pl>

No documentation is available for compiling the .c file to a binary.
This works, but produces a binary that crashes:

  ./assemble.pl examples/assembly/life.pasm > life.pbc
  perl pbc2c.pl life.pbc > life.c
  ls **/*.o | egrep -v 'pdump|test_main' | xargs gcc -Iinclude -o life life.c -lm -ldl
