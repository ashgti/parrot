=head1 ABSTRACT

This document defines a standard format for documenting Perl
development decisions - the how and why of Perl internals, as well as
the surrounding ethos and culture of the development community.  This
document identifies Perl Design Document Format 1.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the shortcomings of most long-term development and maintenance
efforts - and Perl has been no exception - is the lack of readily
available documentation describing the rationale behind many of the
implementation decisions.  News archives and mailing archives are
becoming increasingly difficult to find random information in,
particularly with the myriad lists that Perl 6 begot.

Although there will always be decisions which are obvious due to a lack
of alternatives, many design decisions may have multiple technically
feasible solutions.  Why X instead of Y?  Why this instead of that?  Is
the decision based on an obscure bit of technical arcana?  Is the
decision based on Perl culture, which itself is a product of many of
the undocumented decisions made before?  Or is the decision truly a
toss-up, with a solution picked pseudo-randomly?

A Perl Design Document (PDD) is a readily available record of th
An historical record of the rationale behind the decision.  A PDD
provides context to future developers, who may not have been familiar
with the original discussion, but are currently involved with the
resultant implementation.

=item 3

An historical technical and cultural perspective for future development
work.  Re-implementation or even tangential tasks need only address what
has changed since the original PDD.

=back

It is not a vehicle for brainstorming or creating a wish-list.  PDDs
are reserved for a concrete snapshot of what B<is>, and what B<will>
be.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

All newly created PDDs will adhere to the PDD standard
PDDs should be limited to a specific area of Perl - in the above case,
sorting - but should be broad enough to include the reasons for and
against any specific implementation that may be discussed.  Historical
perspectives can be contrasted and compared through archived versions
of a PDD, vice multiple searches through archived versions of I<n>
number of PDDs.

=item VERSION:

Contains current and selected historical metadata on the PDD itself.

=over 4

=item CURRENT:

Contains the following information, current as of the date of
submission.

=over 4

=item Maintainer

Required.  The name and current email address for the POC of the PDD. 
PDDs should be scoped to their lowest level.

=item PDD Number

Required.  Newly created PDDs should have a PDD Number of I<TBD>.  PDD
Numbers will be assigned by the Perl Librarian, based on the following
scheme:

=over 4

=item *

C<Informational> PDDs are given a PDD Number of C<I#>, where C<#> is a
one-up integer based on order of release by the Perl Librarian.

=item *

C<Experimental> PDDs are given a PDD Number of C<X#>, where C<#> is a
one-up integer based on order of release by the Perl Librarian.

=item *

C<Proposed> PDDs are B<not> given a PDD Number.  They are given an
unprefixed one-up integer when promoted to C<Developing>.
Documentation on an experimental feature or use of Perl, such as
porting Perl to a PS2.

=item Superceded by PDD #

Replaced in whole by another PDD.

=item Obsolete

Naturally obsolete.

=back

=item STANDARD TRACK

=over 4

=item Proposed

A rough draft submitted for consideration from the Perl development
community at large.  A snapshot of the general discussion
surrounding issue foo, but may not accurately reflect the true
direction the community wishes to go.

=item Developing

An acceptable (at least, on theory) PDD that needs much further
fleshing out and fine tuning.  The PDD, as well as the
implementation it describes are both unde
=item Language

Optional.  The language the PDD is written in.  

=back

=item HISTORY:

A list of free-flow descriptions of significant metadata changes, such
as status changes, or change of maintainers.  Each entry should include
the version, date, and nature of the change.  This provides a quick
historical glimpse to the major metadata changes of a PDD.

=back

=item CHANGES:

A summary of the changes since the last version.  A comprehensive
change log should be kept, but only within a supporting document.

=item ABSTRACT:

A quick blurb explaining the purpose of the PDD.

=item DESCRIPTION:

A description of the general nature of the P=item REFERENCES:

References to additional sources of information, but not those
necessary for the PDD itself.

=back

The PDD author may add any additional sections he or she wishes.

=head2 SUBMISSION CRITERIA

It is expected that all PDDs submitted as a proposal will have
undergone an actual discussion within the applicable group(s). 
Following a general consensus of the need for a PDD (and, hopefully, a
general consensus on the particular slant of a PDD proposal), the PDD
can be submitted to the Perl Librarian.

The Perl Librarian should check the document for format, and either
return to the PDD to the maintainer for correction, or pubut otherwise require the same submittal process as regular PDDs.

=head2 PDD TRANSLATIONS

Should a PDD be translated into another language, the following
guidelines should be met.

=over 4

=item *

The C<Maintainer> field should reflect who did the translation.

=item *

The C<Version> number should match the original document's C<Version>
number.  Should multiple translated versions of a single original PDD
be done (to correct spellings, etc), the revision specific to that
document version should be included in parentheses following the
version number.

=item *

Attributions in the C<HISTORY> section should be left alone.

=back

=head2 PDD STATUS CHANGES

Only Larry, a project leader, pumpking, or working group chair may set
C<Status> to anything other than C<Proposed>, C<Informational>, or
C<Experimental>.

=head2 AVAILABILITY

All C<Proposed>, C<Informational>, and C<Experimental> PDDs should be
readily available, in a centralized location, to at least the current
Perl development circles.  All C<Standard>-track PDDs should be
readily available, in a centralized location, to the general public.

All C<Superseded> PDDs should be available upon request.  All
historical versions of PDDs should be available upon request.
