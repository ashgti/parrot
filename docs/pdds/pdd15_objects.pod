=head1 ABSTRACT

This PDD describes the semantics of Parrot's object and class
systems. The PDD is divided into two parts, the semantics expressed
to user programs through PMCs, and the default back-end class scheme.

Note that the class system is I<not> the single mandated class
scheme, merely the one designed to express the semantics needed for
perl 6, ruby, and python. Alternate class systems are certainly
possible, and direct compatibility with the system as described here
isn't strictly necessary.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PDD lays out two separate things.

The first is the object semantics, as presented to user programs. This
means that code has an object PMC, and wants to do Object Things with
it. Object semantics are reasonably simple, and will be defined in a bit.

The second is class semantics. Class semantics are rather more
complex, and can't really be dealt with in a generic way, such that
all classes are compatible. As such this PDD lays out Parrot's default
class semantics, and it is assumed that languages that need different
semantics will then do whatever they need to, provided that the
objects they create are generically usable.

Please see the glossary for definitions of the various terms.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

=head2 Objects

Objects must do the following things. Note that these are required of
PMCs in general, but objects are presumed to actually do something
useful with these things rather than just (potentially) throwing an
exception.

Strictly speaking, getting and setting properties is a PMC thing
rather than an object thing, as PMCs are

=head1 TRANSLATION AND GLOSSARY

Since every object system on the planet shares a common set of terms
but uses them completely differently, this section defines

=head2 Glossary

=over 4

=item Property

A name and value pair attached to a PMC. Properties may be attached to
the PMC in its role as a container or the PMC in its role as a value.

Properties are global to the PMC. That is there can only be one
property named "FOO" attached to a PMC, and it is globally visible to
all inspectors of the PMCs properties. They are I<not> restricted by
class.

Properties are generally assigned at runtime, and a particular
property may or may not exist on a PMC at any particular
time. Properties are not restricted to objects as such, and any PMC
may have a property attached to it.

=item Attribute

An attribute is a slot in an object that contains a value, generally a
PMC. (Containing non-PMCs leads to interesting garbage collection
issues at the moment) Attributes are referenced either
by slot number or by class name/attribute name pairs. (At least
conceptually)

Attributes are set on a class-wide basis, and all the objects of a
class will have the same set of attributes. Generally attributes
aren't added or removed from classes at runtime, as this would require
resizing and moving the elements of the attribute arrays of existing
objects, and potentially recompiling code with fixed attribute offsets
embedded in it. Most OO languages don't allow attribute changes to
existing classes, though parrot's base attribute system does allow
this.

=item Method

In its strictest sense, a method is a chunk of code that you call with
an object in the object slot of the calling conventions.

More generally, a method is some piece of code that you invoke by name
through an object. You call the object's "Invoke a method" vtable
entry, passing in the method name (Assuming we don't just get it from
the sub name register, per calling conventions). The object is then
responsible for doing something with the method being
requested. Presumably it calls the method, though this isn't strictly
required.

=item Delegate

An object that is transparently (to the user) embedded in another
object. Delegate objects are used in those cases where we can't
inherit from a class because the class is from a different object
universe.
