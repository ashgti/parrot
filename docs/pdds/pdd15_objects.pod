This PDD describes the semantics of Parrot's object and class
systems. The PDD is divided into two parts, the semantics expressed
to user programs through PMCs, and the default back-end class scheme.

scheme, merely the one designed to express the semantics needed for
perl 6, ruby, and python. Alternate class systems are certainly
possible, and direct compatibility with the system as described here
isn't strictly necessary.
