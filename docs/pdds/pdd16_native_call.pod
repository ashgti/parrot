=head1 ABSTRACT

This PDD describes the native call interface, and the function
signatures used to describe those functions.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The NCI is designed to allow Parrot to interface to I<most> of the
functions in a C library without having to write any C code for that
interface. It isn't designed to be a universal C-less
interface--there will always be libraries that have some bizarre
parameter list that requires that some C be written. It should,
however, handle all the simple cases.

Using the NCI, parrot automatically wraps the C functions and presents
them as prototyped subroutines that follow normal parrot calling
conventions, and can be called like any other parrot subroutine.

The NCI uses the platform native dynamic by-name function loading
mechanism (dlopen/dlsym on unix and LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress on
Win32, for example) to get the function pointer, then dymanically
generates the wrapper based on the signature of that function.

As there is no good platform-independent way to determine function
signatures (C header files are not always available (certainly not
for libraries not designed for access from C) and not always
reasonably parseable anyway, and there is no generic way to query a
function for its signature) the signature must be passed in when the
linkage between the C function and parrot is made. 

=head2 Function signatures

The following list are the valid letters in the function signatures
for Parrot's NCI. Note that only letters and numbers are valid, and
each letter represents a single parameter passed into the NCI. Note
that the letters are case-sensitive, and must be within the base
7-bit ASCII character set.

At some point punctuation may be used as modifiers on the function
parameters, in which case each parameter may be represented by
multiple letters.

In I<no> case should the signature letters be separated by
whitespace. This restriction may be lifted in the future, but for now
remains as an avenue for adding additional functionality.

=item C

This parameter is used for passing in a callback function pointer. It
refers to the function Parrot_callback_C, which has a signature of:

  void Parrot_callback_C(void *external_data, PMC *callback_info);

More explanation in the L<callbacks> section.

=item D

This parameter is used for passing in a callback function pointer. It
refers to the function Parrot_callback_C, which has a signature of:

  void Parrot_callback_D(PMC *callback_info, void *external_data);

More explanation in the L<callbacks> section.

=item Y

This parameter is a PMC for the sub which should be called into by
the callback. Only valid in a signature with a C or D parameter, and
it I<must> be immediately followed by a parameter of type Z.

=item Z

This parameter is a PMC representing the data to be passed into the
function being called into. It is only valid when it immediately
follows a parameter of type Y.

=back

Note that not all types are valid as return types. 

=head2 Examples

Most of the function parameters are reasonably self-evident. Some,
however, merit additional explanation. The 

=head2 Callbacks

Some libraries, particularly ones implementing more complex
functionality such as databases or GUIs, want callbacks, that is ways
to call a function under the control of the library rather than under
control of the interpreter. These functions must be C functions, and
generally are passed parameters to indicate what should be done.

Unfortunately there's no good way to generically describe all
possible callback parameter sets, so in some cases hand-written C
will be necessary. However, many callback functions share a common
signature, and parrot provides some ready-made functions for this
purpose that should serve for most of the callback uses.

There are two callback functions, Parrot_callback_C and
Parrot_callback_D, corresponding to callback function signature
letters C and D, respectively. If the callback function is supposed
to look like:

   void (function *)(void *library_data, void *your_data);

then use type C, where if the function signature is:

   void (function *)(void *library_data, void *your_data);

then use a type of D. The actual pointer types for the parameters
don't have to be void *, but they must be pointers of some sort.

Since parrot needs more than just a pointer to a generic function to
figure out what to do, it stuffs all the extra information into the
C<your_data> pointer, which contains a custom PMC holding all the
information that Parrot needs. 

The NCI function signature for a callback matching Parrot_callback_C
is C<vCYZ>, while the function signature for a callback matching
Parrot_callback_D is C<vDYZ>
