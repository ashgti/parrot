=head1 TITLE

extend.pod - Parrot extension system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a rough version of the extension documentation for Parrot. It
should be cleaned up and made into a PDD before final release.

The extension API for parrot is a simple, somewhat abstract,
interface to Parrot for code written in C or other compiled
languages. It provides about equivalent access to Parrot that
bytecode programs have.
