=item C<Parrot_call_method(Parrot_INTERP interp, Parrot_PMC sub
       Parrot_PMC object, Parrot_STRING method, const char *signature, ...)>

Calls a method on C<object> with the given signature and arguments. If C<sub>
is not NULL, then it is used as the method that's being called. C<method> will
then be used as the name of the method in the call stack. This is useful for
calling aliased methods. If C<sub> is NULL, then C<method> is looked up and the
method returned by that is used.
