=head1 NAME

tools/build/ops2c.pl - Parser for .ops files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    % perl tools/build/ops2c.pl trans [--help] [--no-lines] [--dynamic]
                                      [--core | input.ops [input2.ops ...]]
       trans := C | CGoto | CGP | CSwitch | CPrederef

For example:

    % perl tools/build/ops2c.pl C --core

    % perl tools/build/ops2c.pl C --dynamic myops.ops

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script uses a supplied transform to create a pair of C header and
implementation files from the operation definitions found in one or more
F<*.ops> files.

=head2 Transforms

The first command-line argument is the last package name component of a
subclass of C<Parrot::OpTrans>. These subclasses all have full names of
the form C<Parrot::OpTrans::*>. An instance of the class is created and
later consulted for various bits of information needed to generate the C
code. Each creates a different type of run loop.

=over

=item C<C>

Create the function-based (slow or fast core) run loop.

=item C<CGoto>

Create the C<goto> run loop.

=item C<CGP>

Create the C<goto> and predereferenced run loop.

=item C<CSwitch>

Create the C<switch>ed and predereferenced run loop.

=item C<CPrederef>

Create the predereferenced run loop.

=back

=head2 Options

=over 4

=item C<--help>

Print synopsis.

=item C<--dynamic>

Indicate that the opcode library is dynamic.

=item C<--core>

Build the Parrot core opcode library.

=item C<--no-lines>

Do not generate C<#line> directives in the generated C code.

=head1 NOTE

Most of the functionality in F<tools/build/ops2c.pl> has been extracted into
methods and subroutines found in Parrot::Ops2c::Utils and
Parrot::Ops2c::Auxiliary.  This refactoring facilitates unit testing and
coverage analysis of that functionality.  A test suite has been provided in
F<t/tools/ops2cutils/>.  It is recommended that future refactoring of this
functionality proceed in a test-driven manner, I<i.e.,> tests should be
written reflecting any changes to interface or functionality; the code should
be written which implements the revisions; the code should be tested; and
coverage analysis should be performed with Devel::Cover to measure the extent
to which the tests exercise the code.
