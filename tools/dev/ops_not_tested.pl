=head1 NAME

tools/dev/ops_not_tested.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The problem this program addresses is described in this IRC log:

10:23 <toor> # Tests - ~1/3 of opcodes are uncovered by tests <--
             were can I see which ones are not
             tested? (yes, maybe I want to write some tests :p)

10:25 <@leo> toor: run 'make testr', then create a script that runs
             disassemble [sic] $_.pbc for all @pbcs,
             extract the opcode, sort, uniq and compare with
             lib/Parrot/OpLib/core.pm
10:26 <@leo> disassemble even
10:26 <@leo> $ make disassemble
10:28 <toor> leo: and if I make a perl5 script that does that
             automagically, is it usefull [sic] for the
             project?
10:28 <@leo> very useful
10:28 <toor> ok, looks that I've got something to start :)
10:28 <@leo> great, thanks
