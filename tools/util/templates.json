On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot @release.version@
\"@release.name@.\" Parrot (@web.root@) is a virtual machine aimed
at running all dynamic languages.

Parrot @release.version@ can be obtained via CPAN (soon), or follow the
download instructions at @web.root@@web.source@.
For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or help develop
Parrot itself, we recommend using Subversion or SVK on the
source code repository to get the latest and best Parrot code.

Parrot @release.version@ News:
@NEWS@

Thanks to all our contributors for making this possible, and our
sponsors for supporting this project.

Enjoy!

Bug Day

On @bugday.day@, @bugday.date@, please join us on IRC in #parrot
(irc.perl.org) to work on closing out as many RT (https://rt.perl.org/
rt3/) tickets as possible in the parrot queue. This will help us get
ready for the next release of parrot: @release.version@, scheduled for @release.day@,
@release.date@. You'll find C, parrot assembly, perl, documentation,
and plenty of tasks to go around. Core developers will be available
most of the day (starting at around 10am GMT) to answer questions.

No experience with parrot necessary.

--From: @wiki.root@@wiki.bugday@--
There's a milestone ticket here:

@rt.root@@rt.tracking@

Which contains all the tickets I'd like to see resolved in @version@. If
you just want to view the unresolved tickets, you can use this saved
search:

@rt.saved_search@

If you've got something you're working on that you think you'll be
getting done before the release, please
- add a ticket for it (if necessary);
- add it as a dependency for this ticket

Thanks in advance for your patches and commits. ^_^

... Speaking of patches, we should also get through as many of these
(accept or reject) as possible.
