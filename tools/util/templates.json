On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot @release.version@
\"@release.name@.\" Parrot (@web.root@) is a virtual machine aimed
at running all dynamic languages.

Parrot @release.version@ is available on Parrot's FTP site, or follow the
download instructions at @web.root@@web.source@.  For those who would like to
develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using Subversion
on the source code repository to get the latest and best Parrot code.

Parrot @release.version@ News:
@NEWS@

Many thanks to all our contributors for making this possible, and our sponsors
for supporting this project.  Our next scheduled release is @release.nextdate@.

Enjoy!

Bug Day

On @bugday.day@, @bugday.date@, please join us on IRC in #parrot
(irc.parrot.org) to work on closing out as many RT (https://rt.perl.org/
rt3/) tickets as possible in the parrot queue. This will help us get
ready for the next release of parrot: @release.version@, scheduled for @release.day@,
@release.date@. You'll find C, parrot assembly, perl, documentation,
and plenty of tasks to go around. Core developers will be available
most of the day (starting at around 10am GMT) to answer questions.

No experience with parrot necessary.

--From: @wiki.root@@wiki.bugday@--

Check the list at:

https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/report/3

Which contains all the tickets I'd like to see resolved in @version@. To
see all the open tickets, use:

https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/report

If you've got something you're working on that you think you'll be
getting done before the release, please
- add a ticket for it (if necessary);
- set its milestone to this release.

Thanks in advance for your patches and commits. ^_^

... Speaking of patches, we should also get through as many of these
(accept or reject) as possible.
