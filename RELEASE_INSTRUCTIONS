To prepare a release:

    0.  Announce to perl6-internals and #parrot at least a
        couple days in advance, asking if there are any
        showstopping bugs.

    1.  cvs update.

    2.  Update files with version-specific information:

        a.  Increment the version number in VERSION.

        b.  Change the information in DEVELOPING to reflect
            this release's version number and date.

        c.  Update README.

        d.  Update ChangeLog and NEWS.

        e.  Make sure nothing in TODO has been done.

        f.  Make sure RESPONSIBLE_PARTIES is still
            accurate.

    3.  cvs commit.

    4.  Delete DEVELOPING.  If it appears in the MANIFEST, 
        delete its entry in MANIFEST as well.  (This will
        remove the 'devel' postfix from the version 
        number--e.g. 0.0.8, as opposed to 0.0.8-devel, 
        which is the number you'd get by downloading from 
        CVS and getting a DEVELOPING file.)
        
    5.  make distclean.
    
    6.  Run tools/dev/manicheck.pl and fix any errors it finds.
        
    7.  Make sure everything works--Configure, make and 
        make test.  Check the Tinderbox and make sure that 
        everything's green (or that any yellows and reds are
        due to problems with the particular box, like a
        botched compiler upgrade).

    8.  make distclean again.

    9.  tar, gzip, and upload to CPAN.

    10. Compose and send out the announcements--perl6-internals,
        -language, -announce, perl5-porters, use Perl, PerlMonks,
        comp.lang.perl.misc, etc.

    11. You're done!  Help yourself to a beer, cola or other
        celebratory drink.

ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT:

This document was written after a couple of subtly incorrectly
assembled releases--usually when someone forgot to delete 
DEVELOPING, but at least once where the MANIFEST check failed.
The intent of this file is to document what must be done to 
release so that such mistakes don't happen again.
