# This file shows the history of incompatible changes to
# Parrot that invalidated existing PBC (Parrot Byte Code) files.
#
# The text in this file is also the base of the
# fingerprint inside PBCs and Parrot which is used
# for validation.
#
# Its pobably not complete or out of date - but a start
# to get less restrictive fingerprint tests.
#
# Currently known actions that should be entered here
#   (and invalidate PBC are):
#
# - bumping Parrot version
# - deleting/changing/inserting existing ops in ops.num
# - changing operands of existing ops
# - adding/deleting/renaming a PMC to classes
# - changes in the packfile format itself
# - other core changes that invalidate byte code :)
#
# After changing PBC_COMPAT either disable t/native_pbc tests or
# better, if you have an i386 box at hand, regenerate the PBCs
# with tools/dev/mk_native_pbc and commit the changes

# please insert tab separated entries at the top of the list
