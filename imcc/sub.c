/*
 * sub.c
 *
 * Calling Conventions API for generating subs definitions, calls, etc.
 *
 * Called by the code generators, optimizers and flow graph code which
 * are mostly independent of the low-level call conventions.
 *
 * Depending on compiler pragmas this API will callout to one of several
 * supported code generators. (see pcc.c or fastcall.c)
 *
 * The default is PCC (prototyped and non-prototyped).
 * PCC (Parrot Calling Convention) is the default for Perl6 and other
 * languages that want to interface with Perl6 on Parrot. PCC works
 * well with continuations and co-routines.
 *
 * Plans are for a FASTCALL convention which can be enabled with:
 * .pragma fastcall
 * which will allow library developers (or non-Perl languages) to turn
 * on very efficient calling conventions. It could also be used for internal
 * libs that do not callout to PCC routines, but present PCC entry points
 * for the module itself.
 *
 * Currently the only fully functional convention is PCC but the generic
 * API allows us to experiment with calling conventions side by
 * side without completely breaking IMCC every time we tweak something.
 * The side effect is the subroutine code generators and optimizers can be
 * very modular and less interlocked to a specific convention.
