BUGS:

 - lexer doesn't impose limits on identifiers, this could lead
   to buffer overflows.
   So there are a bunch of unsafe strcats and sprintfs, some of them
   marked XXX.

 - IMCC does produce b0rken PASM files, when compiling .imc source
   files with duplicate local labels.
   Also label fixup handling is different so just don't compile
   PIR files to PASM except for debugging.

 - statements like "print NO_SUCH_IDENT" are valid, the identifier
   evaluates to -1. There is currently no way, to distinguish a label
   from an identifier, because ops definition files are missing hints,
   which argument might really be a label.
   (Both "branch x" and "print x" are equivalent, basically)
