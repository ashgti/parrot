Note: To add things to the web-visible TODO list, living at
http://www.parrotcode.org/todo, send them in to
bugs-parrot@bugs6.perl.org. They then need to be tagged as todo in the
RT web interface.

Tests
-----

    Unify t/* and imcc/t/* tests, so that one harness has just one
    result summary.
    Run different run cores inside Test.pm.

String subsystem
----------------

    Rework string iterators
    Implement character class & properties testing (for regular expressions)
    Automate string vtable generation
    Fill in vtables for non-ASCII encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc.

    Find a decent way of including Unicode properties tables. (Not for
    the faint of heart.)

Vtables
-------
    PythonInteger/String/Object?

JIT
---
    More instructions needed!
    Make it work on more architectures

Configure system
----------------
    Long term, should be replaced with a bootstrapping miniparrot system.
    Short term, fix the dependencies (eg, more needs to depend on classes/*)
    Platform-independent library creation for pbc2c.pl & extensions
    Valgrind test target on supporting platforms

IO
--
    Async IO
    Full going-over to make sure it works
    Socket IO
    Docs!


Regular expression engine
-------------------------
    Implement case folding
    More speed!

Interpreter
-----------
    Combine dynamic op lib cores.
    Make the MMD tables shareable between interpreters for faster
    startup. (Though there are issues with this)

Opcodes
-------

Mark branch arguments in ops files, e.g. addr/constaddr INT instead of
in/inconst INT.

Assembler
---------
    Debugging and source line number info

Bytecode
--------
    Metadata (source line number info, symbol table)

pdump
-----
    Dumping constants shouldn't unpack the constants, but
    just print out the segment.

Stability
---------
    Purify, Valgrind, and other memory badness detectors

Performance
-----------
    Mo' betta benchmarks
    Add profiling build options
    Add the above to tinderbox

Documentation
-------------
    Update docs and pdds to reflect current state.
    Parrotguts currently too difficult to approach

Debugger
--------
    Add commands history and completion
    Load the commands from a file
    Make breakpoints at labels
    Read core dumps
    Attach to a running program
    List breakpoints.
