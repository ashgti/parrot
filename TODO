Automate numbering of opcodes - this is paramount
Add a configure system - this is relatively paramount

grep docs/strings.pod for unimplemented functions and implement them

Implement transcoding

Automate string vtable generation

Implement PMCs (!) [ This isn't actually that bad, just needs thought. ]

Fix assembler to allow you to use something like:
	add I4, I4, 3
rather than:
	add_i_ic I4, I4, 3

Fix disassembler to recognise new bytecode format. If possible, abstract
out bytecode-reading/writing stuff to a separate Perl module so we can
change the format without breaking the (dis)assembler.
