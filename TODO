String subsystem
----------------
    grep docs/strings.pod for unimplemented functions and implement them
    Implement transcoding
    Automate string vtable generation
    Fill in vtables for non-ASCII encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc.

    Find a decent way of including Unicode properties tables. (Not for
    the feint of heart.)

Vtables
-------
    Fix vtable key support for hashes and arrays
    PythonInteger/String/Object?

JIT

    More instructions needed!

Configure system
----------------
    Long term, should be replaced with a bootstrapping miniparrot system.

Regular expression engine
-------------------------
    Implement case folding
    More speed!
    Implement a regex compiler
