PGE - the Parrot/Perl Grammar Engine

=head2 Description

This is the base file for the grammar engine.  It basically combines
(via .include) each of the separate PGE modules into a single compilation
unit, and then calls the "__onload" subroutines for each.  We do
this because as of this writing (2005-May-03) the semantics of
multiple :load pragmas in a single compilation unit aren't well
defined.
