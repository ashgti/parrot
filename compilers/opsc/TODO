Simple todo.

Required for initial self-hosting:

  * Update config/gen/makefiles/root.in to use opsc instead of ops2c
  * Pass Ops::OpLib to Ops::File to skip ops.

Required for full implementation:
  * Implement Trans::* for other runcores.
  * Add tests for Trans::C independent from 06-emitter.t
  * Add tests for dynamic mode of Emitter.

Nice to have:
  * (almost mandatory) Cache regexes used for Op body munching.
  * Profiling and performance tuning of ops parsing (we need pmichaud).
  * A LOT OF DOCUMENTATION.
