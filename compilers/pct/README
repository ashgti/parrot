=head1 Parrot Compiler Toolkit (PCT)

This is an implementation of an abstract tree representation
and compiler for Parrot.  This version is a redesign based
on PAST-pm.  Only simple nodes are available, but it will
expand rapidly.

There aren't any compilers using PCT yet, but that should
change soon.
