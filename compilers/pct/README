=head1 Parrot abstract syntax tree

This is a new implementation of PAST, the Parrot abstract syntax
tree.  It's still somewhat early, only simple PAST nodes are
available, but it will expand rapidly as we identify more features
to be added.

PAST also needs documentation.  In lieu of documentation, the
best examples to look at thus far are in L<languages/abc> and
L<languages/perl6>.
