TASKS LIST FOR PIRC COMPLETION

This is an overview of tasks in order to complete PIRC.
By "complete", or "completion", it is meant to be able
to use PIRC as a PIR compiler, without needing the current
PIR compiler, IMCC.

Fairly randomly sorted, the tasks are:

1.  Emit the actual bytecodes into a PackFile/codesegment.

2.  Create a PMC constant for strings, numbers, keys and
    subroutines.

3.  Complete PASM output, so it can actually be parsed and run.

More tasks will be added as I think of them. --kjs
