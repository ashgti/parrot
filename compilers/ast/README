NOTE: The directory contains an early prototype for a "Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree"
compiler of Parrot.  It is not being developed anymore, and there is no plan to
continue its development in the future.

See examples/past and t/pmc/eval.t for examples.
Particularly you should be able to do:

  ./parrot examples/past/hello.past
